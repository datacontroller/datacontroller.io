# SaasNow Partnership

The Data Controller for SAS® team is pleased to announce a new partnership! Customers can now obtain Data Controller for SAS® directly from SaasNow - a respected SAS Partner based in the Netherlands.

Purchasing Data Controller directly through a partner such as SaasNow provides several benefits:

### Rapid Installation

As a new SaasNow customer, your Data Controller installation may be as easy as clicking a button. If you have an existing partner relationship, you have a team ready with the knowledge & skills to deploy & configure Data Controller seamlessly into your SAS platform.

### Ease of Support

With a partner as your first line of support, you can leverage a single process for all SAS-related requests, including Data Controller. For complex, non-standard issues, partners have the full and immediate support of the Data Controller for SAS® team.

### Ease of Billing

No need to onboard a new vendor or deal with multiple invoices! You can manage Data Controller as part of a single partner agreement. There are also the following differences to the [standard pricing model](/pricing) when purchasing from SaasNow:
