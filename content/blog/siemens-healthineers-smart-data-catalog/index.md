Data Controller was implemented at Siemens Healthineers to facilitate their SAS-Powered Smart Data Catalog and integrate with Data Lineage reporting. We are grateful to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/helen-stark-5bb15b6a/">Helen Stark</a> (Power User) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hans-juergen-kopperger-942634b7/">Hans-Juergen Kopperger</a> (SAS App Developer) for sharing their "before and after" experiences. The previous article in this series is available <a href="https://datacontroller.io/der-touristik/">here</a>. <hr /> <h2 aria-level="2">Helen Stark<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/helen-stark-5bb15b6a/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1171" src="https://datacontroller.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/thumbnail_HStark-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="200" /></a></h2> <h3 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Hi Helen, it’s great to meet with you today. Can you tell us - what is your role within the business?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3> <span data-contrast="auto">I am the portfolio manager. What I do is a lot of demand management. </span><span data-contrast="auto">So</span><span data-contrast="auto"> when people have new requests, like they want new data into our data lake, or they want it structured, or they want it visualized then I manage all that. For the Americas region, for North and south America. And I also do road shows, like marketing kind of aspect for the data scientists. And I do a smidge of project management here and there.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span> <h3 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Interesting. And what do you actually use Data Controller for?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3> <span data-contrast="auto">I use it to keep our Smart Data Catalog up to date. One of the things that I do is we have marketing posters, and so I put the links to those marketing posters in </span><span data-contrast="auto">there</span><span data-contrast="auto"> so they are a part of our </span><span data-contrast="auto">front end</span><span data-contrast="auto"> web design. And I also do the marketing videos, so adding those links. So really </span><span data-contrast="auto">it</span><span data-contrast="auto">’</span><span data-contrast="auto">s</span><span data-contrast="auto"> just adding and deleting entries into Data Controller, so that our Smart Data Catalog </span><span data-contrast="auto">is updated at all times</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span> <h3 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">And that Smart Data Catalog is in SAS. Is there reason its in SAS, and not say - Excel? Is it used by other parts of the business?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3> <span data-contrast="auto">Yes, it’s used by the entire business</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span> <h3 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">I see. And what is the Smart Data Catalog?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3> <span data-contrast="auto">It's a listing of all of the offerings that data governance has. So, I say data governance but its data governance and analytical services. So, we are the data owners for all of the data in the company. It’s the single source of truth for all Siemens health business data. And we use Data Controller to manage that. And Data Controller does some incredible things that I do not understand – such as being able to stage and preview the data before it’s made publicly available. I mean I honestly don’t understand it but it does some miraculous things.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span> <h3 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Nice feedback! Next question. How does Data Controller make your life easier?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3> <span data-contrast="auto">Because it's so easy to use. Before we used an excel spreadsheet and it was quite unwieldy and it was bulky and it was so easy to make mistakes, just trying to remember where you were. And with Data Controller I love that I can filter first and get to exactly where I want to be and then I can edit. So, it really lessens the chance of me making a mistake. I love that, I am an editor, I am not an approver, but I like so I make an edit, but then it goes to an approver, so it’s like the four eye principle, something we did not have before. You can track changes, that’s amazing. Yeah, it made everything easier so whereas before I would dread updating the Smart Data Catalog, now you go in and it’s done in like 3 to 5 minutes.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span> <h3 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Superb. Ok, before Data Controller came along, how did you get data into SAS?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3> <span data-contrast="auto">So again, it was the foundation of this spreadsheet. You would have to check it out so there was some control over it. If somebody checked it out then nobody else could go in and make any changes, and you would have to wait for it to be checked back in and then run like a macro or some tool and then you could upload it and you could update your smart data search. </span><span data-contrast="auto">I</span><span data-contrast="auto">t was a process that depended on how careful your co-workers were</span><span data-contrast="auto"> about </span><span data-contrast="auto">remembering to check it back in. In short, it used to often take days to update the SAS environment, and now it takes minutes.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span> <h3 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Wow - that’s great to hear! Ok, Next up. What are your favourite Data Controller features and why?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3> <span data-contrast="auto">The filter. It will always be my favourite; it will never change. That’s really helpful. I just like how it makes it so much harder to make a mistake. With Data Controller it</span><span data-contrast="auto">’</span><span data-contrast="auto">s</span><span data-contrast="auto"> much harder to make a mistake. It’s less prone to human error. And the copy and paste </span><span data-contrast="auto">is</span><span data-contrast="auto"> so easy, and yeah, there is nothing about it that I don’t love.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span> <h3 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Brilliant, I think that’s the best feedback we’ve ever had.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3> <span data-contrast="auto">Really, I mean it has made our lives so much easier, so much faster. Um yeah, I just love it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span> <h3 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Thankyou so much!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3> <hr /> <h2 aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="none">Hans-Juergen</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hans-juergen-kopperger-942634b7/"><img class="alignright wp-image-1181" src="https://datacontroller.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0-1-1-200x300.jpeg" alt="Hans-Juergen" width="150" height="225" /></a></span></h2> <h3 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Guten</span><span data-contrast="none"> Morgen Hans-Juergen!

Now they can do their jobs more effectively without struggling to find and access accurate, complete, and trustworthy data. As a result, they spend less time searching for data and can </span><span data-contrast="auto">actually focus</span><span data-contrast="auto"> on using data to generate analyses and impactful insights.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span> <h3 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Now that's valuable!</span><span data-contrast="none"> And what </span><span data-contrast="none">do you use Data Controller for?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3> <span data-contrast="auto">To increase Data Quality while uploading </span><span data-contrast="auto">backend </span><span data-contrast="auto">data into our BI platform. </span><span data-contrast="auto"> Data Controller provides “data v</span><span data-contrast="auto">ersion control</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><span data-contrast="auto">and </span><span data-contrast="auto">full </span><span data-contrast="auto">traceability of changes</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">We have several control tables that provide data for web applications like the "Smart Data </span><span data-contrast="auto">Catalog</span><span data-contrast="auto">"</span><span data-contrast="auto">, and with</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Data</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">Controller it's now an easy, controllable and manageable process to get these changes into the backend tables.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span> <span data-contrast="auto">In the past we had a custom Stored Process web app for uploading excel files, based on a</span><span data-contrast="auto">n excel</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">template. T</span><span data-contrast="auto">his process </span><span data-contrast="auto">had negative consequences for Data Quality</span><span data-contrast="auto"> because it often happened that many different versions of the excel templates were created and in the end we didn't know w</span><span data-contrast="auto">hich </span><span data-contrast="auto">was the latest version and which values we wanted to upload into the system. It could take a lot of time to clarify who had done which upload.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span> <span data-contrast="auto">I would often receive support tickets in relation to this upload, the cause of which was often due to the diversity of our excel templates, and being unsure which was the right template...So, we would have a lot of discussions about how to bring data into the backend in a controlled manner.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span> <span data-contrast="auto">Then one day, I got information through <a href="https://sasusergroup.de/">SAS User Group Germany</a> that you provide a solution with Data Controller. I was initially interested in the <a href="https://docs.datacontroller.io/videos/#data-lineage">Data Lineage</a> functionality, but then I understood the main concept behind Data Controller. And for me the main benefit is that I can save a lot of time - with out of the box features like the web data editor, and the web upload facility with excel spreadsheet drag and drop. </span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">And there is the automatic workflow behind with the mandatory approval step. Since we implemented Data Controller, </span><span data-contrast="auto">we no longer get those support tickets.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span> <h3 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Fantastic. If you had to pick your top features, what would they be?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3> <span data-contrast="auto">The main benefit is getting data controlled, and into the backend. The controlled process, and the approval process, those are the main benefits. But we've got other benefits. For instance, we have Data Lineage now. The Data Lineage diagrams could also be linked directly from our Smart Data </span><span data-contrast="auto">Catalog</span><span data-contrast="auto"> using URL parameters</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">This easy i</span><span data-contrast="auto">ntegration </span><span data-contrast="auto">means </span><span data-contrast="auto">our users can open the relevant page in Data Controller with one click.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span> <span data-contrast="auto">The transparency of the history page is a</span><span data-contrast="auto">nother </span><span data-contrast="auto">benefit. I can look at every requested submit or approval - what changes have been applied, what changes have been submitted, and what changes have been approved. This helps us a lot to get data transparency.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span> <span data-contrast="auto">The <a href="https://docs.datacontroller.io/emails/">email alerts</a> </span><span data-contrast="auto">is</span><span data-contrast="auto"> a great feature. </span><span data-contrast="auto">For the communication of changes, we had previously created a team's collaboration chat. e.g. if </span><span data-contrast="auto">someone </span><span data-contrast="auto">did a change and needed</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to request</span><span data-contrast="auto"> an approval. But with email alerts, the notification of changes </span><span data-contrast="auto">is now automatically sent to the</span><span data-contrast="auto"> responsible</span><span data-contrast="auto"> data owner</span><span data-contrast="auto">, who can </span><span data-contrast="auto">immediately click the </span><span data-contrast="auto">email </span><span data-contrast="auto">link and </span><span data-contrast="auto">do his approval</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">This </span><span data-contrast="auto">speed</span><span data-contrast="auto">s</span><span data-contrast="auto"> up the whole process.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span> <span data-contrast="auto">Another advantage is the</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span><span data-contrast="auto">"database approach" for updates. So, someone is changing one row in a table which is connected to his use case, another guy can change other rows of the same table, nearly simultaneously. Because not everyone is changing the same rows. Everyone has their own subset of rows, their own "workspace" within one table. </span><span data-contrast="auto">I</span><span data-contrast="auto">n the past we would have one excel template, and this would always override all values. We would have a lot of excel templates going around our colleagues, so there were always conflicts of overrides and versioning, and stuff like that. With Data Controller, it's</span><span data-contrast="auto"> now</span><span data-contrast="auto"> a simple</span><span data-contrast="auto">, easy and transparent data capture process.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span> <h3 aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="none">Vielen</span><span data-contrast="none"> Dank!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3> <hr />
