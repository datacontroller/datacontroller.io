Data Controller for SAS® was a finalist in the 2021 "Excellence in Innovation" award!

Each year, SAS recognises a partner that has demonstrated outstanding innovation by adding their own intellectual property to SAS software in order to uniquely solve a complex customer business problem. <a href="https://sasapps.io">Analytium</a> is one of the "chosen four", from among over 1800 partners globally!

## Award Process
There was a strict 15 minute virtual presentation, that began with a 3-4 minute "customer elevator pitch" to explain the customer value of the solution. The remaining time delved into the technical side of things, plus Q&amp;A. There were around 12 SAS employees on the call, with a mix of backgrounds, and assessment was made across three dimensions:

* Does the solution represent unique innovation?
* Is the solution a valuable addition to SAS Software (ie, "fills a gap")?
* Does the solution solve a customer need?

For our part, we began the presentation with an animated video, that explored some of the pain points solved by Data Controller, such as:

* Batch stability
* End User Computing
* Audit investigations

On the innovation side, we talked about some of the following unique capabilities we have built to deliver customer value:

* Ability to deploy without a web server (streaming app capability)
* The DevOps framework, which we have open-sourced (<a href="https://sasjs.io">SASjs</a>)
* Cross SAS-Platform technology (Viya, SAS 9, and soon - desktop SAS also)

As well as an overview of the list of features we have built, to extend the value of SAS Software:

* SAS 9<a href="https://docs.datacontroller.io/videos/#data-lineage"> Data Lineage diagrams</a> that can be exported as PNG, SVG or CSV
