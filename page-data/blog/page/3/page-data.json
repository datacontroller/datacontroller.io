You googled, and discovered 5000 different methods.  Which to choose?  We compare and contrast 5 approaches to this perennial problem.  Before we get onto that though - <strong>why</strong> is it such a problem?</p>\n<p>The crux of the issue is: <h2>Flexibility vs Scalability</h2></p>\n<p>Excel, as you probably know, is incredibly flexible. Data can spread in all directions, move around, be positioned anywhere, on any cell, of any worksheet in a workbook. That workbook can have different names, exist in different locations, be of different types (xls, xlsx, xlsm). That's before we get down to whether the data arrives as values, formatted values, formulas, or <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/allanbowe_data-engineers-in-your-experience-what-activity-6771408875544461312-Weqt\">other dragons</a>. And the fact that, as it is typically stored on a shared filesystem, it can be changed by anyone, at any time.</p>\n<p>SAS is far less flexible in this regard. Data is nearly always structured in a table, with fixed columns, of fixed data types, in a fixed library / location, with a fixed name (or naming convention). That table usually lives on a server, perhaps in a database. This rigidity is actually a Very. Good. Thing. It provides consistency, which is the basis for scalability. And the basis of the consistency is how the data is modelled.</p>\n<h2>The Data Model</h2>\n<p>Every table in SAS contains some kind of metadata about how the data is structured - the column names, types (character vs numeric), formats (dates, currency), lengths, encoding (UTF8 vs WLATIN1) and more. The first question you need to ask yourself, when loading Excel data into SAS, is - do I take the model from Excel? Or am I targeting an existing model in SAS?</p>\n<p>Speaking of SAS. The word \"SAS\" can mean so many things - do we mean the language? The platform? The company? A specific product? Let's break this down, as the choice of tool will depend on the type of \"SAS\" you have.</p>\n<h2>Which Flavour of SAS do I have?</h2>\n<p>The world of SAS can be broken into 3 major platforms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Base SAS. Traditional SAS, typically installed on your desktop.</li>\n<li>SAS Meta. An enterprise deployment with mid-tier and metadata server.</li>\n<li>SAS Viya. Cloud native, API driven microservices architecture.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The options available to you for importing Excel will vary depending on the flavour you are using. How do you know which one you have? Try running the following code in SAS:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sas\">filename mc url \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sasjs/core/main/all.sas\";\n%inc mc;\n%put %mf_getplatform();\n</code></pre>\n<p>The entry in the log will tell you if your environment is BASESAS, SASMETA or SASVIYA.</p>\n<h2>Importing Excel into SAS</h2>\n<p>Without further ado, let's explore the options available!</p>\n<h3>1 - Import Excel with Data Controller for SAS</h3>\n<p>It's <em>super easy</em> to import an arbitrary Excel file to an <strong>existing</strong> table using Data Controller for SAS. You simply choose the table you'd like to modify, then drag your Excel file into the browser.</p>\n<p>Data Controller will scan every worksheet in your Excel file to find a range that matches the target table. How does it do that? The top of the range is identified by simply checking for a <em>row</em> that contains<em> all columns</em> as per the target table definition, whereas the bottom of the range is simply the first blank primary key value.</p>\n<p>Once the range is found, Data Controller will perform a series of automatic checks and validations, and import the data and a copy of the workbook. If all the checks pass, it's one button click to load the data (and corresponding workbook) to the SAS server and notify the approver that a change request has been submitted.</p>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.53333333333334%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <div class=\"embedVideo-container\"> <iframe title=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/417808409\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe\" style=\"border:0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \" loading=\"eager\" allowfullscreen=\"\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"></iframe> </div> </div></p>\n<p>Once the approver approves the change, the table is updated. There is a full audit history and you can even retrieve the original excel file that was submitted. The tool does NOT let you load <em>new</em> tables to SAS, nor does it let you modify the columns. The <em>model</em> is therefore protected by IT, whilst the <em>values</em> are managed by the business.</p>\n<p>Data Controller is available for all 3 SAS platforms (SAS Meta, SAS Viya, Base SAS). Like what you see? Don't hesitate to <a href=\"https://datacontroller.io\">book a demo session</a> and meet the team!</p>\n<h3>2 - Import Excel using SAS Studio</h3>\n<img class=\"alignright\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2IrsV7v.png\" alt=\"Upload File to SAS Studio\" width=\"352\" height=\"442\" />\n<p>This approach can be used whether you are using SAS Meta, SAS Viya, or even Base SAS (eg with University Edition). Just open [YOURSERVER]/SASStudio in a browser (on Viya, it will be /SASStudio<strong>V</strong>).</p>\n<p>The first step will be to get the Excel file to a location where it can be accessed by SAS.</p>\n<p>On Viya, that will require opening the Explorer menu, expanding the server dropdown, and right clicking on the directory within. You can then choose the \"Upload files\" option to import your spreadsheet. Your upload is limited to 100mb (default system setting), and the target directory is typically the unix home directory for your user.</p>\n<p>The \"home directory\" part is a key point - as it means that other users will not necessarily be able to access that source file. To easily load to other areas on the SAS filesystem you may need to ask your admin to create a symlink, or use an alternative upload mechanism (such as <a href=\"https://sasjs.io/apps/#viya-file-uploader\">this one</a>).</p>\n<img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-10_15-53.png\" alt=\"Import Excel to SAS Studio\" width=\"218\" height=\"203\" />\n<p>Once your file is available on the server, you can begin the import process. Simply click on the Start Page, \"New Import\" and follow the steps in the wizard.</p>\n<p>The generated SAS code will be shown in the window below, and the output can be directed to either to WORK or a permanent library as desired.</p>\n<p>You may need to rename the default target dataset (eg from IMPORT to IMPORT2) in order to run the code.</p>\n<h3>3 - How to Import Excel using the SAS Add-In for Microsoft Office</h3>\n<p>Unlike the other examples presented, this one allows you to load data from directly within your Excel workbook! You must have the requisite permission to make data write-back to the target table selected. You can also modify column properties and specify an 'inactivity timeout' before 'edit mode' is closed.\nTo use, simply open your desired table and click the \"Begin Edit\" button in the SAS Ribbon.</p>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.53333333333334%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <div class=\"embedVideo-container\"> <iframe title=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XrK3hmYO4ag?rel=0\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe\" style=\"border:0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \" loading=\"eager\" allowfullscreen=\"\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"></iframe> </div> </div></p>\n<p>The SAS Add-In for Microsoft Office is available only for SAS Meta deployments.</p>\n<h3>4 - Import Excel using the SAS Enterprise Guide Wizard</h3>\n<img class=\"alignright\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/import_excel_into_EG_03.jpg\" alt=\"SAS Enterprise Guide\" width=\"500\" height=\"284\" />\n<p>To import a spreadsheet using Enterprise Guide you can simply click \"File\" then \"Import Data\" and select your Excel file to proceed through the wizard. An excellent guide to this process is available <a href=\"https://bi-notes.com/sas-enterprise-guide-import-excel/\">here</a>. This process will load an Excel table into your SAS project, where you can run further analyses.\nThis approach will work for both SAS Meta and Base SAS deployments, the key difference being that for SAS Meta your tables will be on the SAS Server as opposed to the local desktop.</p>\n<h3>5 - Import Excel using the SAS Data Integration Studio</h3>\n<p>This option is more for SAS 9 ETL developers building enterprise data flows from stable data sources. Many ETL teams are forced to build flows Excel, despite it's (deserved) reputation as an \"unstable data source\".\nOne way to perform this task is to set up a library using the EXCEL engine, then register the tables within it. This involves a number of steps, the screenshots for which are below!\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Excel-in-DI-Studio.png\" alt=\"Import Excel to SAS DI Studio\" width=\"683\" height=\"984\" /></p>\n<h2>Comparison of Methods</h2>\n<p>With so many methods, how do you choose the one that is right for you? This depends on the volume, velocity, variety, and <em>purpose</em> of the data you are loading. If your Excel is large, has a static structure, and arrives directly from a source system on a regular basis in a fixed location, then you would probably want to build an automated flow using Data Integration Studio. For ad-hoc data, prepared by technical analysts for departmental reporting then either Enterprise Guide, SAS Studio or the SAS Addin are potential choices.</p>\n<p>For <em>business</em>-<em>sourced</em> data (such as model parameter sets, reference data, actuarial assumptions) that need to be updated in an <em>IT-secured</em> environment then Data Controller is an<strong> ideal choice.</strong> Particularly given that it eliminates the need for a shared directory and reduces the risk of downstream batch incidents due to 'validate on load' features.</p>\n<p>Data Controller works well as a zero-code option for Excel imports, in the following scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The extraction process must be dynamic, as data can sometimes have additional columns or differently named worksheets</li>\n<li>You need to upload data rapidly and don't have time for a fully automated ETL solution to be built &#x26; deployed</li>\n<li>You must retain the original Excel, along with change metadata, for audit purposes</li>\n<li>Your SAS Admin does not have capacity for ad-hoc data modification requests</li>\n<li>You would like to separate the role of Data Submitter and Data Approver</li>\n<li>Your data model needs protecting from accidental corruption</li>\n<li>You need automatic Data Quality rules applied at source</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below is a further comparison of the different options:</p>\n <img class=\"aligncenter size-full\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dcgrid-1.png\" alt=\"Data Controller compared\" width=\"558\" height=\"436\" />\n<p>If you'd like to discuss potential use cases for Data Controller, or to get a deep dive into any of it's features, you can begin the process right now by requesting a <a href=\"https://datacontroller.io/contact\">demo session</a>!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/5-zero-code-ways-to-import-excel-into-sas/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Five Zero-Code ways to Import Excel into SAS","date":"April 18, 2021","author":"Allan Bowe","authorLink":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanbowe/","previewImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/043577231d674d7161ae729c465039a2/5e981/dcgrid.png","srcSet":"/static/043577231d674d7161ae729c465039a2/0ac2e/dcgrid.png 143w,\n/static/043577231d674d7161ae729c465039a2/90c96/dcgrid.png 285w,\n/static/043577231d674d7161ae729c465039a2/5e981/dcgrid.png 570w","sizes":"(min-width: 570px) 570px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/043577231d674d7161ae729c465039a2/8990e/dcgrid.webp 143w,\n/static/043577231d674d7161ae729c465039a2/3a47a/dcgrid.webp 285w,\n/static/043577231d674d7161ae729c465039a2/20ad4/dcgrid.webp 570w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 570px) 570px, 100vw"}]},"width":570,"height":472.99999999999994}}}}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>Data Controller for SAS was deployed at Allianz to support a bitemporal reporting capability for the actuarial team. <a href=\"https://datacontroller.io/bitemporal-historisation-and-the-sas-dds/\">Bitemporal</a> tables allow data to be stored across two time dimensions - a business (reporting) history and a technical (version) history. This enables results for any previous reporting period to be reproduced 'as at' any point in time, providing full auditability and traceability. By using Data Controller, the actuarial team at Allianz were able to upload data from multiple sources, and have it automatically merged into their SAS reporting database. We caught up with Joris Jansen, Actuary for P&#x26;C Reserving.</p>\n<hr>\n<img class=\"alignright\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/view.jpeg\" alt=\"Data Controller for SAS at Allianz Insurance\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" />\n<h3>Joris, hallo! Could you please explain to us, your role within Allianz?</h3>\n<p>My role, Allan, is a \"reporting role\" in the business of the Allianz Benelux insurance company. This means that every month I need to report all the figures to my management in an accurate, complete and timely way - and this is important for Allianz Management in order to steer the company in the right way. I'm responsible for ensuring the reporting processes are performed properly, and of course, that the output is correct. The Data Controller is helping me to do this.</p>\n<h3>Great! And how does it help? What do you use Data Controller for?</h3>\n<p>The Data Controller I use for the upload of the source data for my calculations. You can imagine I have source data from let's say, different systems or queries or whatever, and I upload this with the Data Controller. I then have the data available and can perform my calculations on the data in SAS, and output the figures for reporting.</p>\n<h3>And why is it that you use Data Controller and not any other tools for uploading that data?</h3>\n<p>Well I think that you, Allan, have given Allianz a really easy tool to use, to do this part in a uniform, simple and proper way. Also the sources are from different systems so the unification of those different data sources isn't that easy - and Data Controller is a really simple tool to make that happen. I have my inputs from different systems available and in a relatively easy way I can upload them.</p>\n<p>Automation may be much better but it's not that easy and practical to do.</p>\n<h3>I see. And what format do these files arrive in?</h3>\n<p>The inputs are all Excel or CSV files and it's easy to input them.</p>\n<h3>What happens to this data after it is uploaded?</h3>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://docs.datacontroller.io/dcc-tables/#pre_edit_hook\">hook script</a> that runs after the upload that makes sure that all the data is captured in one big database, which is a convenient way to handle the data so it's all together in one place. Before Data Controller, this wasn't the case. The advantage of having this data all merged automatically with each upload means that our subsequent processes that calculate the amounts as an output from the source is more uniform. Where we previously had many programs and input locations that would make calculations on top of one another, there are now just 1 to 3 programs.</p>\n<h3>Is anyone else making use of Data Controller?</h3>\n<p>Currently there are three heavy users, and also other departments make use of it, eg the audit department, concerned with models and calculations, will make checks to ensure it works properly on a regular basis.</p>\n<h3>What would you say are your favourite features in Data Controller, and why?</h3>\n<p>The most important feature is the uniform way in which data is uploaded and merged automatically in one database. Which means we always have our data, in an accurate and complete way, available. It is not that easy to adjust the database, and before Data Controller was in place it was possible to accidentally modify data because it was just sitting on the directory, the network drive. It is now not so easy to do that, the data is uploaded in a uniform way and always protected. We have a better, more proper way of reporting.</p>\n<p>The second is that if auditors have extra questions, or would like to investigate other scenarios for calculating the outputs, then we can re-perform very easily the calculation because the data is already available [* with bi-temporal history in a database]. We don't need to do something extra, we can recalculate whenever we want. It's not something we use regularly but it is there, if there are questions from audit or if we would like to change something on the longer term etc, for change management purposes. This is a very nice feature.</p>\n<h3>Glad to hear it! Is there anything you'd like to see in DC?</h3>\n<p>I'm currently very satisfied, it works, it's very fast, it's really quick to use. Which makes it very efficient.</p>\n<h3>Erg bedankt!</h3>\n<hr>\n<p>The previous article in this series is available <a href=\"/siemens-healthineers-smart-data-catalog/\">here</a>.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/allianz-insurance-data-controller-sas/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Allianz Insurance and Data Controller for SAS®","date":"March 26, 2021","author":"Allan Bowe","authorLink":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanbowe/","previewImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#082888","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5908c8879af74a978e5a2c7e9e14c398/43df1/Allianz_logo.svg_.png","srcSet":"/static/5908c8879af74a978e5a2c7e9e14c398/59dc1/Allianz_logo.svg_.png 300w,\n/static/5908c8879af74a978e5a2c7e9e14c398/a4f11/Allianz_logo.svg_.png 600w,\n/static/5908c8879af74a978e5a2c7e9e14c398/43df1/Allianz_logo.svg_.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5908c8879af74a978e5a2c7e9e14c398/f17fd/Allianz_logo.svg_.webp 300w,\n/static/5908c8879af74a978e5a2c7e9e14c398/76f3d/Allianz_logo.svg_.webp 600w,\n/static/5908c8879af74a978e5a2c7e9e14c398/5e38a/Allianz_logo.svg_.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":536}}}}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>Following a busy few months, a number of new deployments and feedback from several customers we are <noframes></noframes>w ready to release version 3.11 of Data Controller for SAS©.

So you can safely modify that 100 million row table! Or use our generic macro to perform incremental loads as part of your batch process.</li>\n<li>LOCALE switch - you can now explicitly set your locale (can be useful when importing CSV or Excel as the loader uses anydtdtme. informats)</li>\n<li>DATA LINEAGE for PROC TRANSPOSE - previously our SAS 9 column level lineage diagrams did not support this transform. Now it does! With thanks to <a href=\"/siemens-healthineers-smart-data-catalog/\">Hans-Juergen</a> for his contribution.</li>\n<li>Reason message in emails - previously we were not showing the SUBMIT or REJECT messages in the notification emails. Now, we do.</li>\n<li>Drag &#x26; Drop Excel or CSV directly over the table to upload (no need to click the 'upload' button any more)</li>\n<li>Separator on the number of observations - handy when your table has billions of rows. 23,456,233,677 is easier to read than 23456233677!</li>\n<li>Discard button - in case you uploaded the wrong Excel</li>\n<li>Refresh button - no need to navigate away and back (or refresh the entire app) to refresh the data</li>\n<li>Refactored and improved FILTER interface (now with datetime pickers)</li>\n<li>Streamlined Viya Deployment</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In the VIEWER, there was an issue where tables were not shown where the libref in metadata was in lowercase and library level permissions were applied. This is now fixed.</li>\n<li>There was an issue where the only 'PROCESSED' column name was 'PROCESSED_DTTM'. You can now designate any (numeric) column to be updated with the current timestamp when that record is modified.</li>\n<li>File downloads in Viya now work when deployed to contexts other than 'SAS Job Execution compute context'</li>\n<li>Column widths can now be modified when using the filtered view of the table</li>\n<li>ACCEPT / REJECT buttons are now disabled if the user is not in the APPROVE group</li>\n<li>The app no longer fails if a trailing slash is provided by the user in the DCPATH variable</li>\n<li>Fixed issue where arrow was not shown in the Handsontable dropdown for some selectbox types</li>\n<li>Updated User Navigator in Viya to show additional user specific info</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Redshift</h2>\n<p>The loading routine for Redshift makes use of configurable bulkload options via the MPE_CONFIG table. The MPE_DATALOADS table tracks every time a table is loaded, showing the number of records added, removed, and modified - along with details of who made the update, when, a reason code, and which table was modified. Full table copies are avoided by performing SQL pass through in SAS©.</p>\n<h2>Other areas</h2>\n<p>We've also made significant strides in our DevOps thanks to the <a href=\"https://sasjs.io\">SASjs</a> framework, brought the product into the <a href=\"https://sasapps.io\">Analytium</a> fold (UK SAS Partner), and - in addition to a standard pricing - we have put together a reseller pack.

Can you tell us - what is your role within the business?</h3>\n<p>I am the portfolio manager. What I do is a lot of demand management. So when people have new requests, like they want new data into our data lake, or they want it structured, or they want it visualized then I manage all that. For the Americas region, for North and south America. And I also do road shows, like marketing kind of aspect for the data scientists. And I do a smidge of project management here and there.</p>\n<h3>Interesting. And what do you actually use Data Controller for?</h3>\n<p>I use it to keep our Smart Data Catalog up to date. One of the things that I do is we have marketing posters, and so I put the links to those marketing posters in there so they are a part of our front end web design. And I also do the marketing videos, so adding those links. So really it’s just adding and deleting entries into Data Controller, so that our Smart Data Catalog is updated at all times.</p>\n<h3>And that Smart Data Catalog is in SAS. Is there reason its in SAS, and not say - Excel? Is it used by other parts of the business?</h3>\n<p>Yes, it’s used by the entire business</p>\n<h3>I see. And what is the Smart Data Catalog?</h3>\n<p>It's a listing of all of the offerings that data governance has. So, I say data governance but its data governance and analytical services. So, we are the data owners for all of the data in the company. It’s the single source of truth for all Siemens health business data. And we use Data Controller to manage that. And Data Controller does some incredible things that I do not understand – such as being able to stage and preview the data before it’s made publicly available. I mean I honestly don’t understand it but it does some miraculous things.</p>\n<h3>Nice feedback! Next question. How does Data Controller make your life easier?</h3>\n<p>Because it's so easy to use. Before we used an excel spreadsheet and it was quite unwieldy and it was bulky and it was so easy to make mistakes, just trying to remember where you were. And with Data Controller I love that I can filter first and get to exactly where I want to be and then I can edit. So, it really lessens the chance of me making a mistake. I love that, I am an editor, I am not an approver, but I like so I make an edit, but then it goes to an approver, so it’s like the four eye principle, something we did not have before. You can track changes, that’s amazing. Yeah, it made everything easier so whereas before I would dread updating the Smart Data Catalog, now you go in and it’s done in like 3 to 5 minutes.</p>\n<h3>Superb. Ok, before Data Controller came along, how did you get data into SAS?</h3>\n<p>So again, it was the foundation of this spreadsheet. You would have to check it out so there was some control over it. If somebody checked it out then nobody else could go in and make any changes, and you would have to wait for it to be checked back in and then run like a macro or some tool and then you could upload it and you could update your smart data search. It was a process that depended on how careful your co-workers were about remembering to check it back in. In short, it used to often take days to update the SAS environment, and now it takes minutes.</p>\n<h3>Wow - that’s great to hear! Ok, Next up. What are your favourite Data Controller features and why?</h3>\n<p>The filter. It will always be my favourite; it will never change. That’s really helpful. I just like how it makes it so much harder to make a mistake. With Data Controller it’s much harder to make a mistake. It’s less prone to human error. And the copy and paste is so easy, and yeah, there is nothing about it that I don’t love.</p>\n<h3>Brilliant, I think that’s the best feedback we’ve ever had.</h3>\n<p>Really, I mean it has made our lives so much easier, so much faster. Um yeah, I just love it.</p>\n<h3>Thankyou so much!</h3>\n<hr>\n<h2>Hans-Juergen <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hans-juergen-kopperger-942634b7/\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-1181\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0-1-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Hans-Juergen\" width=\"150\" height=\"225\" /></a></h2>\n<h3>Guten Morgen Hans-Juergen! Can you tell us a little about your role within the business?</h3>\n<p>Yes, I am working as a Data Integration Manager at Siemens Healthineers providing BI and Analytical Services for our colleagues. My department is the DGA - Data Governance and Analytical Services. At Siemens-Healthineers we are analyzing \"Big Data\" from our computer systems - AT Angiography and Therapy, Computer Tomography CT, MR Magnetresonanz Tomography, and LD Labordiagnostik.</p>\n<p>In consequence of our Business Strategy \"from Onsite to Online\" our focus is to connect more and more systems to our BI backend. With new services like \"Condition-based Maintenance\" or \"Predictive Analysis\", we can now generate data-driven services to increase business values for our customers or even decrease our overall service costs.</p>\n<p>Our BI platform is based on the SAS technology stack. To get our Business Analysts and Data Scientists nearer to our Data Lake I have created a Smart Data Catalog which is an interactive web application with a \"google style\" search facility. Now they can do their jobs more effectively without struggling to find and access accurate, complete, and trustworthy data. As a result, they spend less time searching for data and can actually focus on using data to generate analyses and impactful insights.</p>\n<h3>Now that's valuable! And what do you use Data Controller for?</h3>\n<p>To increase Data Quality while uploading backend data into our BI platform. Data Controller provides “data version control”, and full traceability of changes. We have several control tables that provide data for web applications like the \"Smart Data Catalog\", and with Data Controller it's now an easy, controllable and manageable process to get these changes into the backend tables.</p>\n<p>In the past we had a custom Stored Process web app for uploading excel files, based on an excel template. This process had negative consequences for Data Quality because it often happened that many different versions of the excel templates were created and in the end we didn't know which was the latest version and which values we wanted to upload into the system. It could take a lot of time to clarify who had done which upload.</p>\n<p>I would often receive support tickets in relation to this upload, the cause of which was often due to the diversity of our excel templates, and being unsure which was the right template...So, we would have a lot of discussions about how to bring data into the backend in a controlled manner.</p>\n<p>Then one day, I got information through <a href=\"https://sasusergroup.de/\">SAS User Group Germany</a> that you provide a solution with Data Controller. I was initially interested in the <a href=\"https://docs.datacontroller.io/videos/#data-lineage\">Data Lineage</a> functionality, but then I understood the main concept behind Data Controller. And for me the main benefit is that I can save a lot of time - with out of the box features like the web data editor, and the web upload facility with excel spreadsheet drag and drop. And there is the automatic workflow behind with the mandatory approval step. Since we implemented Data Controller, we no longer get those support tickets.</p>\n<h3>Fantastic. If you had to pick your top features, what would they be?</h3>\n<p>The main benefit is getting data controlled, and into the backend. The controlled process, and the approval process, those are the main benefits. But we've got other benefits. For instance, we have Data Lineage now. The Data Lineage diagrams could also be linked directly from our Smart Data Catalog using URL parameters. This easy integration means our users can open the relevant page in Data Controller with one click.</p>\n<p>The transparency of the history page is another benefit. I can look at every requested submit or approval - what changes have been applied, what changes have been submitted, and what changes have been approved. This helps us a lot to get data transparency.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.datacontroller.io/emails/\">email alerts</a> is a great feature. For the communication of changes, we had previously created a team's collaboration chat. e.g. if someone did a change and needed to request an approval. But with email alerts, the notification of changes is now automatically sent to the responsible data owner, who can immediately click the email link and do his approval. This speeds up the whole process.</p>\n<p>Another advantage is the \"database approach\" for updates. So, someone is changing one row in a table which is connected to his use case, another guy can change other rows of the same table, nearly simultaneously. Because not everyone is changing the same rows. Everyone has their own subset of rows, their own \"workspace\" within one table. In the past we would have one excel template, and this would always override all values. We would have a lot of excel templates going around our colleagues, so there were always conflicts of overrides and versioning, and stuff like that. With Data Controller, it's now a simple, easy and transparent data capture process.</p>\n<h3>Vielen Dank!</h3>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"imgHolder\">\n  <a href=\"/blog\">\n    <img class=\"wp-image-1190 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Get-Started-Smart-Data-Catalog.png\" alt=\"Smart Data Catalog\" />\n    <div>Smart Data Catalog</div>\n  </a>\n</div>","fields":{"slug":"/siemens-healthineers-smart-data-catalog/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Siemens Healthineers Smart Data Catalog and Data Controller","date":"August 24, 2020","author":"Allan Bowe","authorLink":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanbowe/","previewImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/948c1/siemenshealthineers.png","srcSet":"/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/f95d8/siemenshealthineers.png 144w,\n/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/3fffe/siemenshealthineers.png 288w,\n/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/948c1/siemenshealthineers.png 576w","sizes":"(min-width: 576px) 576px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/13995/siemenshealthineers.webp 144w,\n/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/7ee31/siemenshealthineers.webp 288w,\n/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/27686/siemenshealthineers.webp 576w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 576px) 576px, 100vw"}]},"width":576,"height":144}}}}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has applied to all publicly-traded companies doing business in the US since 2006. The penalties can be severe - if Uncle Sam considers a corporate officer to have deliberately submitted an inaccurate certification, the corporate fine is $5 million with up to twenty years in prison for the individual(s). Accidental mis-certification (or non-submission) is just $1 million and 10 years in prison.</p>\n<p>There are many aspects to full Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) compliance, the <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-107hr3763enr/pdf/BILLS-107hr3763enr.pdf\">legislation</a> is over 60 pages long. As with other regulatory obligations, the goal is to regularly provide enough evidence to satisfy the auditor that the requirements have been met. As anyone running a compliance team knows, this is no small endeavour. The ability to automate the generation of such evidence, or make it available automatically to auditors, can result in significant cost savings. This article breaks down the areas where Data Controller can contribute to satisfying the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.</p>\n<h2>Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404 - MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROLS.</h2>\n<p>Data Controller facilitates internal controls through a 4 eyes review &#x26; approve mechanism for data changes. This, combined with data validation and an integrated workflow feature, provides a mechanism to easily track and report on the number of internal controls (quality rules, signoffs, rejections), as well as the frequency they are applied, who is applying them, which data items the controls relate to, and who is performing them. Such metrics can be compared and contrasted with pre-existing and current quality measures to help determine control effectiveness. Variations in the number of submit / approve cycles between reporting teams, also provide objective and repeatable measurements to support the assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls.</p>\n<div class=\"imgHolder\"><a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-107hr3763enr/pdf/BILLS-107hr3763enr.pdf\"><img class=\"wp-image-1105 size-full aligncenter\" title=\"Sec 404.

To address this, the <a href=\"https://pcaobus.org/\">Public Company Accounting Oversight Board</a> (PCAOB - a US non-profit created by the Sarbanes-Oxley act itself) released<a href=\"https://pcaobus.org/Rulemaking/Docket%20021/2007-06-12_Release_No_2007-005A.pdf\"> additional guidance</a> to assist management and auditors in producing their reports. This is officially labeled \"Auditing Standard No. 5 - <em>An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting That Is Integrated with An Audit of Financial Statements\"</em> A few points are highlighted by the guidance in this standard that are pertinent to users of Data Controller. <h2>PCAOB AS5 Sec24 - Controls Over Management Override</h2> Management Overrides (the freedom to simply \"replace\" reporting figures based on, presumably, sound judgement) are entity level controls that can be easily captured (in a centralised manner) by Data Controller. This in fact, is the \"core functionality\" of the tool. Data Stewards / Data Processors (Editors) make the change, then one or more Data Owners / Data Controllers (Approvers) sign it off before it is applied to the target table. A copy of the original excel file (if used) and a record of who made the change, when, what the change was, and why (if a reason is provided) is recorded. <a href=\"https://docs.datacontroller.io/dcc-validations/\">Data Validation</a> rules can also be defined to ensure that inputs fit the desired pattern(s). <a href=\"https://pcaobus.org/Rulemaking/Docket%20021/2007-06-12_Release_No_2007-005A.pdf\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1122\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-10-10-41-12.png\" alt=\"Sarbanes Oxley sas management overrides\" width=\"887\" height=\"409\" /></a> For fun, we made a short video for this part:</p>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.53333333333334%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <div class=\"embedVideo-container\"> <iframe title=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iY3KQZL4ok0?rel=0\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe\" style=\"border:0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \" loading=\"eager\" allowfullscreen=\"\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"></iframe> </div> </div></p>\n<p>  <h2>PCAOB AS5 Sec27 - Identifying Entity-Level Controls</h2> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1126\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-10-12-58-26.png\" alt=\"Sarbanes Oxley SAS Section 24\" width=\"792\" height=\"198\" /> In the area of documenting the inputs, transformations and outputs of data flows within an organisation, SAS particularly shines, especially in the version 9 world. The table and column level lineage generated by SAS Data Integration provides a highly detailed view of the data lineage. Below is an example of Table level lineage, which colour codes each table according to it's library and captures the detail of each SAS job along the way. Clicking on a job will open the job in the metadata viewer. Clicking the table will open the table in VIEW mode. The lineage is shown all the way from source to target(s), or target to source(s) and can be exported in PNG, SVG, or CSV format.</p>\n<div class=\"imgHolder\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-10-14-41-04.png\" alt=\"SAS Table Level Lineage Sarbanes Oxley\"/><caption>SAS Table Level Lineage</caption></div>\n<p>Below is an example of column level lineage. Like Table Level lineage, this can be performed forwards or backwards and exported in multiple formats. Each arrow represents a SAS transform.

The core programs (services) within the Data Controller application that perform data signoffs are mature, distinct and change tracked - so it is possible for Data Controller to be upgraded in-place without affecting the benchmarking strategy. This contrasts with spreadsheet based control mechanisms, which must be revalidated in each reporting period.</p>\n<div class=\"imgHolder\"><a href=\"https://pcaobus.org/Rulemaking/Docket%20021/2007-06-12_Release_No_2007-005A.pdf\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"PCAOB Release 2007-005A, Appendix B\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-08-22-15-50.png\" alt=\"Sarbanes Oxley SAS\"/></a><caption>PCAOB Release 2007-005A, Appendix B</caption></div>\n<h2>Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 1102 - Tampering</h2>\n<p>Coming back to the original 2002 SOx paper, there is an additional stick being waved against those who destroy records. This is, unfortunately, a common occurrence in DWh landscapes - poorly designed data models often result in frequent rebuilds of monthly datamarts when issues are found. If your BI / ETL teams are routinely destroying / modifying database records as part of regular work efforts, you might wish to: a) ensure there is a well documented ticketing system to make sure those individuals are protected from any accusations, or b) implement a <a href=\"/bitemporal-historisation-and-the-sas-dds/\">Bitemporal</a> data model to ensure a full and transparent version history of data is always kept regardless of rebuilds. IT-secured tools such as Data Controller enable auditors to see easily for themselves who has changed a record, when, why, and who signed it off - thereby vastly reducing the potential for unintentionally impeding an investigation.</p>\n<div class=\"imgHolder\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BILLS-107hr3763enr.pdf\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full\" title=\"SEC. 1102.

Can you tell us about your role within DER Touristik?</h2> Yes, I am working here as project manager for BI and Analytics and my department is the BICC (Business Intelligence Competence Centre), and we have an absolute focus on the SAS technology stack - so that’s my daily business. <h2>Great. And, I understand you guys are using Data Controller for SAS. What do you use it for?</h2> Well, mainly for managing control tables, that we have a lot of nowadays, in the data warehouse. But we also implemented what we call an \"early bird booking system\". There we have used the Approval process within Data Controller, which is excellent, because users, business departments etc, can approve data that would normally only be accessible within the back-end warehouse itself. So now they have an interface, which limits their access to specific views, and this is very useful - it was also highly commended by our management. <h2>So, business users can approve modifications to secure warehouse tables without having direct write-access themselves?</h2> Exactly <h2>Fantastic. Next question. How does having Data Controller make your life easier?</h2> Well - there is the version control of course, that gives us a much better traceability of changes to see what was changed by whom, at what time. And we have the immediate constraint checking which is also very useful because some of the tables are sensitive towards, let’s say, the changes of the primary key. And in the past when we did it the \"old fashioned way\" it was possible that by mistake that someone could cause duplicate primary keys or stuff like that, so this is now not possible anymore, which is very good. And like the example that I mentioned before, that now we can grant access to certain sensitive tables even for business users that would normally have no access, but we can decide whether to give them at least the right to <em>view</em> these tables, or during special events <em>edit</em> tables, or approve edits of those tables. So this gives a lot of opportunities, and makes it much easier than it was in the past. <h2>Nice! And so, talking about the past, before you had Data Controller, how did you manage modifications to data in SAS?</h2> We classically used two approaches - on one hand using SAS Enterprise Guide to directly edit tables or do imports, such as imports of excel sheets for example. On the other hand, we have some batch processes that also do imports of Excel tables or CSV tables. So those were the classic and standard ways. And of course especially the batch one we are still using for some files, depending on the situation. But we do no editing of tables directly with Enterprise Guide anymore because it is much safer and easier to use the Data Controller. <h2>Understood. So on the Data Controller side, what would you say were your favourite features and why?</h2> I would say that I like the editor as a whole very much. I think that is great that in the moment you make a table editable, you can define the ways in which you would edit the tables. Like whether there is some historic logging or not, and the fact you can set the constraints. And in the editor then you have a lot of Data Quality opportunities such as defining drop-down lists for certain attributes, which really makes editing the tables easier and much more comfortable. It was a little bit of a pain in the past but now it’s almost fun. <h2>That's great feedback! Is there anything else, any comments you would like to add?</h2> Yes, I like the fact that Data Controller is really just a part of the SAS environment. It’s not a completely separate application that you have to install somewhere, but a kind of pluggable part of the SAS environment. I liked it very much because then you still have everything in your hands. I mean I am not a developer but my knowledge of SAS is already enough to match the criteria to be able to handle the Data Controller as whole, to even do the updates and/or to modify things. And also it’s easy to show others who have experience with SAS how the tool works and what is to be done when there are data issues. And yeah, I think that’s a big advantage. <img class=\"wp-image-1140 aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Group-1dt-1-e1597092362693.png\" alt=\"SAS DER Touristik\" width=\"242\" height=\"213\" /></p>","fields":{"slug":"/der-touristik/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Data Controller - a BICC perspective","date":"August 10, 2020","author":"Allan Bowe","authorLink":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanbowe/","previewImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/65ef577f76c9ed7ba6a2816ffe8962c3/026c5/Group-1dt.png","srcSet":"/static/65ef577f76c9ed7ba6a2816ffe8962c3/1cc48/Group-1dt.png 219w,\n/static/65ef577f76c9ed7ba6a2816ffe8962c3/fe261/Group-1dt.png 438w,\n/static/65ef577f76c9ed7ba6a2816ffe8962c3/026c5/Group-1dt.png 875w","sizes":"(min-width: 875px) 875px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/65ef577f76c9ed7ba6a2816ffe8962c3/d8972/Group-1dt.webp 219w,\n/static/65ef577f76c9ed7ba6a2816ffe8962c3/360f3/Group-1dt.webp 438w,\n/static/65ef577f76c9ed7ba6a2816ffe8962c3/e6409/Group-1dt.webp 875w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 875px) 875px, 100vw"}]},"width":875,"height":768}}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"page":"index","archives":{"2018":2,"2020":5,"2021":8,"2022":4,"2023":3},"recentPosts":[{"slug":"/v6-1-source-available/","title":"v6.1 Release: Source Available"},{"slug":"/v6-0-api-explorer/","title":"v6.0 Release: Viya API Explorer"},{"slug":"/v5-3-viewboxes/","title":"v5.3 Release: ViewBoxes"},{"slug":"/v5-2-lineage-updates/","title":"v5.2 Release: Lineage Updates"},{"slug":"/v5-1-library-dataset-info/","title":"v5.1 Release: Library & Dataset Info"},{"slug":"/v5-0-column-level-security/","title":"v5.0 Release: Column Level Security"},{"slug":"/v4-0-formats-special-missings/","title":"v4.0 Release: Formats & Special Missings"},{"slug":"/3-13-extended-data-validation/","title":"v3.13 Release: Extended Data Validation and Native Postgres Support"},{"slug":"/saasnow-partnership/","title":"SaasNow Partnership"},{"slug":"/roi-payback/","title":"ROI and Payback"}],"tags":[{"name":"Releases","totalCount":10},{"name":"SAS","totalCount":8},{"name":"Data Lineage","totalCount":5},{"name":"Data Quality","totalCount":5},{"name":"Excel","totalCount":4},{"name":"Use Cases","totalCount":4},{"name":"Regulatory","totalCount":3},{"name":"Data Catalog","totalCount":2},{"name":"Data Management","totalCount":2},{"name":"EUC","totalCount":2}],"filter":{"fileAbsolutePath":{"regex":"/content/blog/"}},"limit":6,"skip":12,"numPages":4,"currentPage":3}},"staticQueryHashes":["615294906"]}
