This enables results for any previous reporting period to be reproduced 'as at' any point in time, providing full auditability and traceability. By using Data Controller, the actuarial team at Allianz were able to upload data from multiple sources, and have it automatically merged into their SAS reporting database. We caught up with Joris Jansen, Actuary for P&#x26;C Reserving.</p>\n<hr>\n<img class=\"alignright\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/view.jpeg\" alt=\"Data Controller for SAS at Allianz Insurance\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" />\n<h3>Joris, hallo! Could you please explain to us, your role within Allianz?</h3>\n<p>My role, Allan, is a \"reporting role\" in the business of the Allianz Benelux insurance company. This means that every month I need to report all the figures to my management in an accurate, complete and timely way - and this is important for Allianz Management in order to steer the company in the right way. I'm responsible for ensuring the reporting processes are performed properly, and of course, that the output is correct. The Data Controller is helping me to do this.</p>\n<h3>Great! And how does it help? What do you use Data Controller for?</h3>\n<p>The Data Controller I use for the upload of the source data for my calculations. You can imagine I have source data from let's say, different systems or queries or whatever, and I upload this with the Data Controller. I then have the data available and can perform my calculations on the data in SAS, and output the figures for reporting.</p>\n<h3>And why is it that you use Data Controller and not any other tools for uploading that data?</h3>\n<p>Well I think that you, Allan, have given Allianz a really easy tool to use, to do this part in a uniform, simple and proper way. Also the sources are from different systems so the unification of those different data sources isn't that easy - and Data Controller is a really simple tool to make that happen. I have my inputs from different systems available and in a relatively easy way I can upload them.</p>\n<p>Automation may be much better but it's not that easy and practical to do.</p>\n<h3>I see. And what format do these files arrive in?</h3>\n<p>The inputs are all Excel or CSV files and it's easy to input them.</p>\n<h3>What happens to this data after it is uploaded?</h3>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://docs.datacontroller.io/dcc-tables/#pre_edit_hook\">hook script</a> that runs after the upload that makes sure that all the data is captured in one big database, which is a convenient way to handle the data so it's all together in one place. Before Data Controller, this wasn't the case. The advantage of having this data all merged automatically with each upload means that our subsequent processes that calculate the amounts as an output from the source is more uniform. Where we previously had many programs and input locations that would make calculations on top of one another, there are now just 1 to 3 programs.</p>\n<h3>Is anyone else making use of Data Controller?</h3>\n<p>Currently there are three heavy users, and also other departments make use of it, eg the audit department, concerned with models and calculations, will make checks to ensure it works properly on a regular basis.</p>\n<h3>What would you say are your favourite features in Data Controller, and why?</h3>\n<p>The most important feature is the uniform way in which data is uploaded and merged automatically in one database. Which means we always have our data, in an accurate and complete way, available. It is not that easy to adjust the database, and before Data Controller was in place it was possible to accidentally modify data because it was just sitting on the directory, the network drive. It is now not so easy to do that, the data is uploaded in a uniform way and always protected. We have a better, more proper way of reporting.</p>\n<p>The second is that if auditors have extra questions, or would like to investigate other scenarios for calculating the outputs, then we can re-perform very easily the calculation because the data is already available [* with bi-temporal history in a database]. We don't need to do something extra, we can recalculate whenever we want. It's not something we use regularly but it is there, if there are questions from audit or if we would like to change something on the longer term etc, for change management purposes. This is a very nice feature.</p>\n<h3>Glad to hear it! Is there anything you'd like to see in DC?</h3>\n<p>I'm currently very satisfied, it works, it's very fast, it's really quick to use. Which makes it very efficient.</p>\n<h3>Erg bedankt!</h3>\n<hr>\n<p>The previous article in this series is available <a href=\"/siemens-healthineers-smart-data-catalog/\">here</a>.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/allianz-insurance-data-controller-sas/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Allianz Insurance and Data Controller for SAS®","date":"March 26, 2021","author":"Allan Bowe","authorLink":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanbowe/","previewImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#082888","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5908c8879af74a978e5a2c7e9e14c398/43df1/Allianz_logo.svg_.png","srcSet":"/static/5908c8879af74a978e5a2c7e9e14c398/59dc1/Allianz_logo.svg_.png 300w,\n/static/5908c8879af74a978e5a2c7e9e14c398/a4f11/Allianz_logo.svg_.png 600w,\n/static/5908c8879af74a978e5a2c7e9e14c398/43df1/Allianz_logo.svg_.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5908c8879af74a978e5a2c7e9e14c398/f17fd/Allianz_logo.svg_.webp 300w,\n/static/5908c8879af74a978e5a2c7e9e14c398/76f3d/Allianz_logo.svg_.webp 600w,\n/static/5908c8879af74a978e5a2c7e9e14c398/5e38a/Allianz_logo.svg_.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":536}}}}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>Following a busy few months, a number of new deployments and feedback from several customers we are <noframes></noframes>w ready to release version 3.11 of Data Controller for SAS©. The biggest news in terms of updates is the addition of the licence key.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>REDSHIFT support - we now provide native pass-through access to Amazon Redshift for all load types (Replace, Update, SCD2 and Bitemporal). So you can safely modify that 100 million row table! Or use our generic macro to perform incremental loads as part of your batch process.</li>\n<li>LOCALE switch - you can now explicitly set your locale (can be useful when importing CSV or Excel as the loader uses anydtdtme. informats)</li>\n<li>DATA LINEAGE for PROC TRANSPOSE - previously our SAS 9 column level lineage diagrams did not support this transform. Now it does! With thanks to <a href=\"/siemens-healthineers-smart-data-catalog/\">Hans-Juergen</a> for his contribution.</li>\n<li>Reason message in emails - previously we were not showing the SUBMIT or REJECT messages in the notification emails. Now, we do.</li>\n<li>Drag &#x26; Drop Excel or CSV directly over the table to upload (no need to click the 'upload' button any more)</li>\n<li>Separator on the number of observations - handy when your table has billions of rows. 23,456,233,677 is easier to read than 23456233677!</li>\n<li>Discard button - in case you uploaded the wrong Excel</li>\n<li>Refresh button - no need to navigate away and back (or refresh the entire app) to refresh the data</li>\n<li>Refactored and improved FILTER interface (now with datetime pickers)</li>\n<li>Streamlined Viya Deployment</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In the VIEWER, there was an issue where tables were not shown where the libref in metadata was in lowercase and library level permissions were applied. This is now fixed.</li>\n<li>There was an issue where the only 'PROCESSED' column name was 'PROCESSED_DTTM'. You can now designate any (numeric) column to be updated with the current timestamp when that record is modified.</li>\n<li>File downloads in Viya now work when deployed to contexts other than 'SAS Job Execution compute context'</li>\n<li>Column widths can now be modified when using the filtered view of the table</li>\n<li>ACCEPT / REJECT buttons are now disabled if the user is not in the APPROVE group</li>\n<li>The app no longer fails if a trailing slash is provided by the user in the DCPATH variable</li>\n<li>Fixed issue where arrow was not shown in the Handsontable dropdown for some selectbox types</li>\n<li>Updated User Navigator in Viya to show additional user specific info</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Redshift</h2>\n<p>The loading routine for Redshift makes use of configurable bulkload options via the MPE_CONFIG table. The MPE_DATALOADS table tracks every time a table is loaded, showing the number of records added, removed, and modified - along with details of who made the update, when, a reason code, and which table was modified. Full table copies are avoided by performing SQL pass through in SAS©.</p>\n<h2>Other areas</h2>\n<p>We've also made significant strides in our DevOps thanks to the <a href=\"https://sasjs.io\">SASjs</a> framework, brought the product into the <a href=\"https://sasapps.io\">Analytium</a> fold (UK SAS Partner), and - in addition to a standard pricing - we have put together a reseller pack. Again, contact <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanbowe/\">Allan Bowe</a> for further details. As a reminder, Data Controller features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to upload any Excel or CSV file to any SAS© registered table</li>\n<li>SAS 9 Table &#x26; Column level lineage with SVG &#x26; PNG export</li>\n<li>Data Edit &#x26; Approval workflow with Audit history</li>\n<li>Export in CSV, Excel, SAS Datalines, DDL format</li>\n<li>User Navigator (Viya + SAS 9)</li>\n<li>SAS 9 Metadata Navigator</li>\n<li>Data Quality rules</li>\n<li>Data Dictionary</li>\n<li>Data Catalog</li>\n<li>Data Alerts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks to SAS/ACCESS engines we can support all major databases, eg Netezza, Teradata, SPDE, Postgres, SQL Server, Redshift etc.</p>\n<p>Further details on the <a href=\"/pricing\">pricing</a> page, else contact <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanbowe/\">Allan Bowe</a>.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/version-3-11-release-notes-redshift-locale-proc-transpose/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Version 3.11 - Release Notes (Redshift, Locale, Proc Transpose)","date":"February 14, 2021","author":"Allan Bowe","authorLink":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanbowe/","previewImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c9603f50b37fd558fcf731f141cad1af/27866/1_5i1_LPEiMqqEuAmYhcmcIw.png","srcSet":"/static/c9603f50b37fd558fcf731f141cad1af/af5b4/1_5i1_LPEiMqqEuAmYhcmcIw.png 88w,\n/static/c9603f50b37fd558fcf731f141cad1af/29e34/1_5i1_LPEiMqqEuAmYhcmcIw.png 175w,\n/static/c9603f50b37fd558fcf731f141cad1af/27866/1_5i1_LPEiMqqEuAmYhcmcIw.png 350w","sizes":"(min-width: 350px) 350px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/c9603f50b37fd558fcf731f141cad1af/017c4/1_5i1_LPEiMqqEuAmYhcmcIw.webp 88w,\n/static/c9603f50b37fd558fcf731f141cad1af/1dac5/1_5i1_LPEiMqqEuAmYhcmcIw.webp 175w,\n/static/c9603f50b37fd558fcf731f141cad1af/4d0bf/1_5i1_LPEiMqqEuAmYhcmcIw.webp 350w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 350px) 350px, 100vw"}]},"width":350,"height":227.99999999999997}}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"page":"year","archives":{"2018":2,"2020":5,"2021":8,"2022":4,"2023":3},"recentPosts":[{"slug":"/v6-1-source-available/","title":"v6.1 Release: Source Available"},{"slug":"/v6-0-api-explorer/","title":"v6.0 Release: Viya API Explorer"},{"slug":"/v5-3-viewboxes/","title":"v5.3 Release: ViewBoxes"},{"slug":"/v5-2-lineage-updates/","title":"v5.2 Release: Lineage Updates"},{"slug":"/v5-1-library-dataset-info/","title":"v5.1 Release: Library & Dataset Info"},{"slug":"/v5-0-column-level-security/","title":"v5.0 Release: Column Level Security"},{"slug":"/v4-0-formats-special-missings/","title":"v4.0 Release: Formats & Special Missings"},{"slug":"/3-13-extended-data-validation/","title":"v3.13 Release: Extended Data Validation and Native Postgres Support"},{"slug":"/saasnow-partnership/","title":"SaasNow Partnership"},{"slug":"/roi-payback/","title":"ROI and Payback"}],"tags":[{"name":"Releases","totalCount":10},{"name":"SAS","totalCount":8},{"name":"Data Lineage","totalCount":5},{"name":"Data Quality","totalCount":5},{"name":"Excel","totalCount":4},{"name":"Use Cases","totalCount":4},{"name":"Regulatory","totalCount":3},{"name":"Data Catalog","totalCount":2},{"name":"Data Management","totalCount":2},{"name":"EUC","totalCount":2}],"filter":{"frontmatter":{"date":{"gte":"2021","lt":"20211"}},"fileAbsolutePath":{"regex":"/content/blog/"}},"limit":6,"skip":6,"numPages":2,"currentPage":2,"year":"2021"}},"staticQueryHashes":["615294906"]}
