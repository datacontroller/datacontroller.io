The biggest news in terms of updates is the addition of the licence key.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>REDSHIFT support - we now provide native pass-through access to Amazon Redshift for all load types (Replace, Update, SCD2 and Bitemporal). So you can safely modify that 100 million row table! Or use our generic macro to perform incremental loads as part of your batch process.</li>\n<li>LOCALE switch - you can now explicitly set your locale (can be useful when importing CSV or Excel as the loader uses anydtdtme. informats)</li>\n<li>DATA LINEAGE for PROC TRANSPOSE - previously our SAS 9 column level lineage diagrams did not support this transform. Now it does! With thanks to <a href=\"/siemens-healthineers-smart-data-catalog/\">Hans-Juergen</a> for his contribution.</li>\n<li>Reason message in emails - previously we were not showing the SUBMIT or REJECT messages in the notification emails. Now, we do.</li>\n<li>Drag &#x26; Drop Excel or CSV directly over the table to upload (no need to click the 'upload' button any more)</li>\n<li>Separator on the number of observations - handy when your table has billions of rows. 23,456,233,677 is easier to read than 23456233677!</li>\n<li>Discard button - in case you uploaded the wrong Excel</li>\n<li>Refresh button - no need to navigate away and back (or refresh the entire app) to refresh the data</li>\n<li>Refactored and improved FILTER interface (now with datetime pickers)</li>\n<li>Streamlined Viya Deployment</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In the VIEWER, there was an issue where tables were not shown where the libref in metadata was in lowercase and library level permissions were applied. This is now fixed.</li>\n<li>There was an issue where the only 'PROCESSED' column name was 'PROCESSED_DTTM'. You can now designate any (numeric) column to be updated with the current timestamp when that record is modified.</li>\n<li>File downloads in Viya now work when deployed to contexts other than 'SAS Job Execution compute context'</li>\n<li>Column widths can now be modified when using the filtered view of the table</li>\n<li>ACCEPT / REJECT buttons are now disabled if the user is not in the APPROVE group</li>\n<li>The app no longer fails if a trailing slash is provided by the user in the DCPATH variable</li>\n<li>Fixed issue where arrow was not shown in the Handsontable dropdown for some selectbox types</li>\n<li>Updated User Navigator in Viya to show additional user specific info</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Redshift</h2>\n<p>The loading routine for Redshift makes use of configurable bulkload options via the MPE_CONFIG table. The MPE_DATALOADS table tracks every time a table is loaded, showing the number of records added, removed, and modified - along with details of who made the update, when, a reason code, and which table was modified. Full table copies are avoided by performing SQL pass through in SASÂ©.</p>\n<h2>Other areas</h2>\n<p>We've also made significant strides in our DevOps thanks to the <a href=\"https://sasjs.io\">SASjs</a> framework, brought the product into the <a href=\"https://sasapps.io\">Analytium</a> fold (UK SAS Partner), and - in addition to a standard pricing - we have put together a reseller pack.

Can you tell us - what is your role within the business?</h3>\n<p>I am the portfolio manager. What I do is a lot of demand management. So when people have new requests, like they want new data into our data lake, or they want it structured, or they want it visualized then I manage all that. For the Americas region, for North and south America. And I also do road shows, like marketing kind of aspect for the data scientists. And I do a smidge of project management here and there.</p>\n<h3>Interesting. And what do you actually use Data Controller for?</h3>\n<p>I use it to keep our Smart Data Catalog up to date. One of the things that I do is we have marketing posters, and so I put the links to those marketing posters in there so they are a part of our front end web design. And I also do the marketing videos, so adding those links. So really itâs just adding and deleting entries into Data Controller, so that our Smart Data Catalog is updated at all times.</p>\n<h3>And that Smart Data Catalog is in SAS. Is there reason its in SAS, and not say - Excel? Is it used by other parts of the business?</h3>\n<p>Yes, itâs used by the entire business</p>\n<h3>I see. And what is the Smart Data Catalog?</h3>\n<p>It's a listing of all of the offerings that data governance has. So, I say data governance but its data governance and analytical services. So, we are the data owners for all of the data in the company. Itâs the single source of truth for all Siemens health business data. And we use Data Controller to manage that. And Data Controller does some incredible things that I do not understand â such as being able to stage and preview the data before itâs made publicly available. I mean I honestly donât understand it but it does some miraculous things.</p>\n<h3>Nice feedback! Next question. How does Data Controller make your life easier?</h3>\n<p>Because it's so easy to use. Before we used an excel spreadsheet and it was quite unwieldy and it was bulky and it was so easy to make mistakes, just trying to remember where you were. And with Data Controller I love that I can filter first and get to exactly where I want to be and then I can edit. So, it really lessens the chance of me making a mistake. I love that, I am an editor, I am not an approver, but I like so I make an edit, but then it goes to an approver, so itâs like the four eye principle, something we did not have before. You can track changes, thatâs amazing. Yeah, it made everything easier so whereas before I would dread updating the Smart Data Catalog, now you go in and itâs done in like 3 to 5 minutes.</p>\n<h3>Superb. Ok, before Data Controller came along, how did you get data into SAS?</h3>\n<p>So again, it was the foundation of this spreadsheet. You would have to check it out so there was some control over it. If somebody checked it out then nobody else could go in and make any changes, and you would have to wait for it to be checked back in and then run like a macro or some tool and then you could upload it and you could update your smart data search. It was a process that depended on how careful your co-workers were about remembering to check it back in. In short, it used to often take days to update the SAS environment, and now it takes minutes.</p>\n<h3>Wow - thatâs great to hear! Ok, Next up. What are your favourite Data Controller features and why?</h3>\n<p>The filter. It will always be my favourite; it will never change. Thatâs really helpful. I just like how it makes it so much harder to make a mistake. With Data Controller itâs much harder to make a mistake. Itâs less prone to human error. And the copy and paste is so easy, and yeah, there is nothing about it that I donât love.</p>\n<h3>Brilliant, I think thatâs the best feedback weâve ever had.</h3>\n<p>Really, I mean it has made our lives so much easier, so much faster. Um yeah, I just love it.</p>\n<h3>Thankyou so much!</h3>\n<hr>\n<h2>Hans-Juergen <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hans-juergen-kopperger-942634b7/\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-1181\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0-1-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Hans-Juergen\" width=\"150\" height=\"225\" /></a></h2>\n<h3>Guten Morgen Hans-Juergen! Can you tell us a little about your role within the business?</h3>\n<p>Yes, I am working as a Data Integration Manager at Siemens Healthineers providing BI and Analytical Services for our colleagues. My department is the DGA - Data Governance and Analytical Services. At Siemens-Healthineers we are analyzing \"Big Data\" from our computer systems - AT Angiography and Therapy, Computer Tomography CT, MR Magnetresonanz Tomography, and LD Labordiagnostik.</p>\n<p>In consequence of our Business Strategy \"from Onsite to Online\" our focus is to connect more and more systems to our BI backend. With new services like \"Condition-based Maintenance\" or \"Predictive Analysis\", we can now generate data-driven services to increase business values for our customers or even decrease our overall service costs.</p>\n<p>Our BI platform is based on the SAS technology stack. To get our Business Analysts and Data Scientists nearer to our Data Lake I have created a Smart Data Catalog which is an interactive web application with a \"google style\" search facility. Now they can do their jobs more effectively without struggling to find and access accurate, complete, and trustworthy data. As a result, they spend less time searching for data and can actually focus on using data to generate analyses and impactful insights.</p>\n<h3>Now that's valuable! And what do you use Data Controller for?</h3>\n<p>To increase Data Quality while uploading backend data into our BI platform. Data Controller provides âdata version controlâ, and full traceability of changes. We have several control tables that provide data for web applications like the \"Smart Data Catalog\", and with Data Controller it's now an easy, controllable and manageable process to get these changes into the backend tables.</p>\n<p>In the past we had a custom Stored Process web app for uploading excel files, based on an excel template. This process had negative consequences for Data Quality because it often happened that many different versions of the excel templates were created and in the end we didn't know which was the latest version and which values we wanted to upload into the system. It could take a lot of time to clarify who had done which upload.</p>\n<p>I would often receive support tickets in relation to this upload, the cause of which was often due to the diversity of our excel templates, and being unsure which was the right template...So, we would have a lot of discussions about how to bring data into the backend in a controlled manner.</p>\n<p>Then one day, I got information through <a href=\"https://sasusergroup.de/\">SAS User Group Germany</a> that you provide a solution with Data Controller. I was initially interested in the <a href=\"https://docs.datacontroller.io/videos/#data-lineage\">Data Lineage</a> functionality, but then I understood the main concept behind Data Controller. And for me the main benefit is that I can save a lot of time - with out of the box features like the web data editor, and the web upload facility with excel spreadsheet drag and drop. And there is the automatic workflow behind with the mandatory approval step. Since we implemented Data Controller, we no longer get those support tickets.</p>\n<h3>Fantastic. If you had to pick your top features, what would they be?</h3>\n<p>The main benefit is getting data controlled, and into the backend. The controlled process, and the approval process, those are the main benefits. But we've got other benefits. For instance, we have Data Lineage now. The Data Lineage diagrams could also be linked directly from our Smart Data Catalog using URL parameters. This easy integration means our users can open the relevant page in Data Controller with one click.</p>\n<p>The transparency of the history page is another benefit. I can look at every requested submit or approval - what changes have been applied, what changes have been submitted, and what changes have been approved. This helps us a lot to get data transparency.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.datacontroller.io/emails/\">email alerts</a> is a great feature. For the communication of changes, we had previously created a team's collaboration chat. e.g. if someone did a change and needed to request an approval. But with email alerts, the notification of changes is now automatically sent to the responsible data owner, who can immediately click the email link and do his approval. This speeds up the whole process.</p>\n<p>Another advantage is the \"database approach\" for updates. So, someone is changing one row in a table which is connected to his use case, another guy can change other rows of the same table, nearly simultaneously. Because not everyone is changing the same rows. Everyone has their own subset of rows, their own \"workspace\" within one table. In the past we would have one excel template, and this would always override all values. We would have a lot of excel templates going around our colleagues, so there were always conflicts of overrides and versioning, and stuff like that. With Data Controller, it's now a simple, easy and transparent data capture process.</p>\n<h3>Vielen Dank!</h3>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"imgHolder\">\n  <a href=\"/blog\">\n    <img class=\"wp-image-1190 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Get-Started-Smart-Data-Catalog.png\" alt=\"Smart Data Catalog\" />\n    <div>Smart Data Catalog</div>\n  </a>\n</div>","fields":{"slug":"/siemens-healthineers-smart-data-catalog/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Siemens Healthineers Smart Data Catalog and Data Controller","date":"August 24, 2020","author":"Allan Bowe","authorLink":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanbowe/","previewImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/948c1/siemenshealthineers.png","srcSet":"/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/f95d8/siemenshealthineers.png 144w,\n/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/3fffe/siemenshealthineers.png 288w,\n/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/948c1/siemenshealthineers.png 576w","sizes":"(min-width: 576px) 576px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/13995/siemenshealthineers.webp 144w,\n/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/7ee31/siemenshealthineers.webp 288w,\n/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/27686/siemenshealthineers.webp 576w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 576px) 576px, 100vw"}]},"width":576,"height":144}}}}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has applied to all publicly-traded companies doing business in the US since 2006.

Such metrics can be compared and contrasted with pre-existing and current quality measures to help determine control effectiveness. Variations in the number of submit / approve cycles between reporting teams, also provide objective and repeatable measurements to support the assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls.</p>\n<div class=\"imgHolder\"><a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-107hr3763enr/pdf/BILLS-107hr3763enr.pdf\"><img class=\"wp-image-1105 size-full aligncenter\" title=\"Sec 404.

To address this, the <a href=\"https://pcaobus.org/\">Public Company Accounting Oversight Board</a> (PCAOB - a US non-profit created by the Sarbanes-Oxley act itself) released<a href=\"https://pcaobus.org/Rulemaking/Docket%20021/2007-06-12_Release_No_2007-005A.pdf\"> additional guidance</a> to assist management and auditors in producing their reports. This is officially labeled \"Auditing Standard No. 5 - <em>An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting That Is Integrated with An Audit of Financial Statements\"</em> A few points are highlighted by the guidance in this standard that are pertinent to users of Data Controller. <h2>PCAOB AS5 Sec24 - Controls Over Management Override</h2> Management Overrides (the freedom to simply \"replace\" reporting figures based on, presumably, sound judgement) are entity level controls that can be easily captured (in a centralised manner) by Data Controller. This in fact, is the \"core functionality\" of the tool. Data Stewards / Data Processors (Editors) make the change, then one or more Data Owners / Data Controllers (Approvers) sign it off before it is applied to the target table. A copy of the original excel file (if used) and a record of who made the change, when, what the change was, and why (if a reason is provided) is recorded. <a href=\"https://docs.datacontroller.io/dcc-validations/\">Data Validation</a> rules can also be defined to ensure that inputs fit the desired pattern(s). <a href=\"https://pcaobus.org/Rulemaking/Docket%20021/2007-06-12_Release_No_2007-005A.pdf\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1122\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-10-10-41-12.png\" alt=\"Sarbanes Oxley sas management overrides\" width=\"887\" height=\"409\" /></a> For fun, we made a short video for this part:</p>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.53333333333334%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <div class=\"embedVideo-container\"> <iframe title=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iY3KQZL4ok0?rel=0\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe\" style=\"border:0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \" loading=\"eager\" allowfullscreen=\"\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"></iframe> </div> </div></p>\n<p>Â  <h2>PCAOB AS5 Sec27 - Identifying Entity-Level Controls</h2> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1126\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-10-12-58-26.png\" alt=\"Sarbanes Oxley SAS Section 24\" width=\"792\" height=\"198\" /> In the area of documenting the inputs, transformations and outputs of data flows within an organisation, SAS particularly shines, especially in the version 9 world. The table and column level lineage generated by SAS Data Integration provides a highly detailed view of the data lineage. Below is an example of Table level lineage, which colour codes each table according to it's library and captures the detail of each SAS job along the way. Clicking on a job will open the job in the metadata viewer. Clicking the table will open the table in VIEW mode. The lineage is shown all the way from source to target(s), or target to source(s) and can be exported in PNG, SVG, or CSV format.</p>\n<div class=\"imgHolder\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-10-14-41-04.png\" alt=\"SAS Table Level Lineage Sarbanes Oxley\"/><caption>SAS Table Level Lineage</caption></div>\n<p>Below is an example of column level lineage. Like Table Level lineage, this can be performed forwards or backwards and exported in multiple formats. Each arrow represents a SAS transform. Where business logic is applied, this is additionally extracted and showed in red.</p>\n<div class=\"imgHolder\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-10-18-42-50.png\" alt=\"SAS Column Level Lineage Sarbanes Oxley\"/><caption>SAS Column Level Lineage</caption></div>\n<p>Â  The ability to define additional data lineages, outside of SAS (eg between spreadsheets or other reporting systems) is in the product roadmap, along with lineage from SAS Viya. <h2>PCAOB AS5 App B - Benchmarking of Automated Controls</h2> The use of IT secured financial controls can significantly reduce the cost of Sarbanes-Oxley compliance testing following the first year assessment, particularly where the source code is secured and cannot be modified by users. The core programs (services) within the Data Controller application that perform data signoffs are mature, distinct and change tracked - so it is possible for Data Controller to be upgraded in-place without affecting the benchmarking strategy. This contrasts with spreadsheet based control mechanisms, which must be revalidated in each reporting period.</p>\n<div class=\"imgHolder\"><a href=\"https://pcaobus.org/Rulemaking/Docket%20021/2007-06-12_Release_No_2007-005A.pdf\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"PCAOB Release 2007-005A, Appendix B\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-08-22-15-50.png\" alt=\"Sarbanes Oxley SAS\"/></a><caption>PCAOB Release 2007-005A, Appendix B</caption></div>\n<h2>Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 1102 - Tampering</h2>\n<p>Coming back to the original 2002 SOx paper, there is an additional stick being waved against those who destroy records. This is, unfortunately, a common occurrence in DWh landscapes - poorly designed data models often result in frequent rebuilds of monthly datamarts when issues are found. If your BI / ETL teams are routinely destroying / modifying database records as part of regular work efforts, you might wish to: a) ensure there is a well documented ticketing system to make sure those individuals are protected from any accusations, or b) implement a <a href=\"/bitemporal-historisation-and-the-sas-dds/\">Bitemporal</a> data model to ensure a full and transparent version history of data is always kept regardless of rebuilds. IT-secured tools such as Data Controller enable auditors to see easily for themselves who has changed a record, when, why, and who signed it off - thereby vastly reducing the potential for unintentionally impeding an investigation.</p>\n<div class=\"imgHolder\"><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BILLS-107hr3763enr.pdf\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full\" title=\"SEC. 1102.

(Sarbanes Oxley)</caption></div>\n<h2>Sarbanes Oxley and SAS</h2>\n<p>We chose SAS as the platform on which to build Data Controller as it is very reliable, provides excellent support for data drivers (enables our code to run inside almost any database), long term customer support, and is very easy to deploy against. The demo version of Data Controller can be <a href=\"https://docs.datacontroller.io/videos/#deploying-data-controller\">deployed in under 30 seconds</a> (on a SAS 9 platform).</p>\n<p>With SAS there are no additional servers to provision, firewalls to configure, scaling issues to address - everything works \"out of the box\". SAS also integrates nicely with existing enterprise authentication mechanisms such as LDAP, and the platform is typically fully secured under your existing IT policies at the backend.</p>\n<p>Data Controller is built on <a href=\"https://sasjs.io\">SASjs</a> and hence we have versions for both SAS 9 and Viya.

We caught up with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rgagor/\">Rafal Gagor</a>, a DI Developer with 2 decades of SAS and Financial Services experience, to get his impressions after using Data Controller for SAS on a client project.</p>\n<h2>So, Rafal - what did your Client use Data Controller for?</h2>\n<p>Data Controller was implemented initially as the backbone of a <a href=\"https://sasjs.io\">SASjs</a> Release Management system - it allowed my colleagues and I to upload, for each promote, a list of affected SAS artefacts along with details of the release, and associated JIRA tickets. We could make changes directly via the web interface, or by uploading an Excel file. It was great to capture that information automatically in a database and have data quality rules applied at source. The resultant \"clean\" data enabled the delivery of a robust release management web application that saved hours of manual effort each week.</p>\n<h2>Nice use case. How did you manage before you had Data Controller?</h2>\n<p>Previously, release management was a process performed manually and inconsistently, with data scattered across dozens of Excel and Word documents - it was not brought into SAS at all. In the case of other, regular, business-sourced tables that needed to be uploaded - the options were to either hand-craft an upload process manually as a \"one off\" using Enterprise Guide, or to build (and deploy) an ETL flow sourced from an Excel or a CSV file deployed to a network drive.</p>\n<p>This option was problematic - how frequently to run the flow? What if the file format changed? What if the target table changed? It was therefore quite convenient to have the ability to hand such processes back to the data owner, who could safely modify the data within Data Controller without running the risk of overwriting any indexes or otherwise changing the schema of the table.</p>\n<h2>Last question. What were your favourite Data Controller features?</h2>\n<p>Probably my favourite feature was the <strong>Metadata Navigator</strong> - I hadn't been able to use this since moving away from Base SAS quite some years ago. It was useful to be able to navigate through the objects and associations, and view the properties and attributes, without writing any code. Next up was the <strong>Data Lineage</strong> explorer.</p>\n<p>When the business told me there was an issue with a particular field, it was really helpful to use the Data Controller graphical tools - at both table and column level - to perform a reverse (Target to Source) lineage diagram and quickly understand the data flow. This avoided the need to open up every job in DI Studio and explore the transforms.</p>\n<p>Although it's a basic feature, it was great to use the <strong>Data Viewer</strong> to quickly examine and explore the raw tables without locking the datasets (and hence running the risk of stopping a batch run). The full-table search was a neat touch, as well as the DDL export option. Finally, I liked the fact that there were separate buttons for SUBMIT and APPROVE - a bit like a database where you have to commit the change. It's a nice approach that gives an extra layer of validation for the changes uploaded.</p>\n<h2>Rafal - many thanks!</h2>","fields":{"slug":"/data-controller-developer-perspective/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Data Controller - a Developer Perspective","date":"July 29, 2020","author":"Allan Bowe","authorLink":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanbowe/","previewImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3795074afaa91c078996114db15428dc/1696a/IMG-20190430-WA0049.jpg","srcSet":"/static/3795074afaa91c078996114db15428dc/cf6cb/IMG-20190430-WA0049.jpg 63w,\n/static/3795074afaa91c078996114db15428dc/7f937/IMG-20190430-WA0049.jpg 125w,\n/static/3795074afaa91c078996114db15428dc/1696a/IMG-20190430-WA0049.jpg 250w","sizes":"(min-width: 250px) 250px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3795074afaa91c078996114db15428dc/35c53/IMG-20190430-WA0049.webp 63w,\n/static/3795074afaa91c078996114db15428dc/70f7f/IMG-20190430-WA0049.webp 125w,\n/static/3795074afaa91c078996114db15428dc/af4b8/IMG-20190430-WA0049.webp 250w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 250px) 250px, 100vw"}]},"width":250,"height":300}}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"page":"category","archives":{"2018":2,"2020":5,"2021":8,"2022":4,"2023":3},"recentPosts":[{"slug":"/v6-1-source-available/","title":"v6.1 Release: Source Available"},{"slug":"/v6-0-api-explorer/","title":"v6.0 Release: Viya API Explorer"},{"slug":"/v5-3-viewboxes/","title":"v5.3 Release: ViewBoxes"},{"slug":"/v5-2-lineage-updates/","title":"v5.2 Release: Lineage Updates"},{"slug":"/v5-1-library-dataset-info/","title":"v5.1 Release: Library & Dataset Info"},{"slug":"/v5-0-column-level-security/","title":"v5.0 Release: Column Level Security"},{"slug":"/v4-0-formats-special-missings/","title":"v4.0 Release: Formats & Special Missings"},{"slug":"/3-13-extended-data-validation/","title":"v3.13 Release: Extended Data Validation and Native Postgres Support"},{"slug":"/saasnow-partnership/","title":"SaasNow Partnership"},{"slug":"/roi-payback/","title":"ROI and Payback"}],"tags":[{"name":"Releases","totalCount":10},{"name":"SAS","totalCount":8},{"name":"Data Lineage","totalCount":5},{"name":"Data Quality","totalCount":5},{"name":"Excel","totalCount":4},{"name":"Use Cases","totalCount":4},{"name":"Regulatory","totalCount":3},{"name":"Data Catalog","totalCount":2},{"name":"Data Management","totalCount":2},{"name":"EUC","totalCount":2}],"filter":{"frontmatter":{"tags":{"in":["Data Lineage"]}}},"limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1,"tag":"Data Lineage"}},"staticQueryHashes":["615294906"]}
