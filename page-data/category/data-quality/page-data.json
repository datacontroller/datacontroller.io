In both cases you should provide the full path and filename in the MPE_VALIDATIONS table.</p>\n<p>More info in <a href=\"https://docs.datacontroller.io/dynamic-cell-dropdown\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Native Postgres Support</h2>\n<p>Alongside Redshift and SQL Server we now have native support for Postgres.

However load times can become significant when the target contains millions (or billions) of rows.</p>\n<p>In order to provide \"native\" support we update our load process to 'inject' a temporary table using SQL passthrough, which results in significantly faster updates for certain load types, such as SCD2.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Did you know Data Controller (Community Edition) is free, for unlimited users? <a href=\"/contact\">Contact us</a> for your copy!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/3-13-extended-data-validation/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"v3.13 Release: Extended Data Validation and Native Postgres Support","date":"September 06, 2021","author":"Allan Bowe","authorLink":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanbowe/","previewImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/bfce32db5dd470a53868f5677c65fb54/7934d/validation1.png","srcSet":"/static/bfce32db5dd470a53868f5677c65fb54/f582d/validation1.png 882w,\n/static/bfce32db5dd470a53868f5677c65fb54/b5dd3/validation1.png 1763w,\n/static/bfce32db5dd470a53868f5677c65fb54/7934d/validation1.png 3526w","sizes":"(min-width: 3526px) 3526px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/bfce32db5dd470a53868f5677c65fb54/c916e/validation1.webp 882w,\n/static/bfce32db5dd470a53868f5677c65fb54/8b9a2/validation1.webp 1763w,\n/static/bfce32db5dd470a53868f5677c65fb54/2e8b1/validation1.webp 3526w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 3526px) 3526px, 100vw"}]},"width":3526,"height":1710}}}}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>Thanks to a customer investment, we have four fantastic new features!  These are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dynamic Filtering (returned values filtered by other clauses in the same filter)</li>\n<li>Ability to upload Excel formulas into SAS</li>\n<li>Row Level Security for all tables in SAS</li>\n<li>Dynamic Cell Dropdown</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That last feature (dynamic cell dropdown) is turning out to be Data Quality Dynamite.  Let's start with it.</p>\n<h2>Dynamic Cell Dropdown</h2>\n<p>This feature allows you to create a backend SAS program to generate the values for the cell dropdown.  The program receives the ROW as input, so you can make the values dependent on other values - such as returning a list of product codes for a particular region, or people within a department.  We are now using it extensively within Data Controller to display tables for a particular library, or columns for a particular table.</p>\n<p>The SAS program can live on the directory, or it can also be in a SAS 9 Stored Process or Viya Job.  The dropdown can be \"HARD\" (user must select a value) or \"SOFT\" (user can also type their own value).</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

Can you tell us - what is your role within the business?</h3>\n<p>I am the portfolio manager. What I do is a lot of demand management. So when people have new requests, like they want new data into our data lake, or they want it structured, or they want it visualized then I manage all that. For the Americas region, for North and south America. And I also do road shows, like marketing kind of aspect for the data scientists. And I do a smidge of project management here and there.</p>\n<h3>Interesting. And what do you actually use Data Controller for?</h3>\n<p>I use it to keep our Smart Data Catalog up to date. One of the things that I do is we have marketing posters, and so I put the links to those marketing posters in there so they are a part of our front end web design. And I also do the marketing videos, so adding those links. So really it’s just adding and deleting entries into Data Controller, so that our Smart Data Catalog is updated at all times.</p>\n<h3>And that Smart Data Catalog is in SAS. Is there reason its in SAS, and not say - Excel? Is it used by other parts of the business?</h3>\n<p>Yes, it’s used by the entire business</p>\n<h3>I see. And what is the Smart Data Catalog?</h3>\n<p>It's a listing of all of the offerings that data governance has. So, I say data governance but its data governance and analytical services. So, we are the data owners for all of the data in the company. It’s the single source of truth for all Siemens health business data. And we use Data Controller to manage that. And Data Controller does some incredible things that I do not understand – such as being able to stage and preview the data before it’s made publicly available. I mean I honestly don’t understand it but it does some miraculous things.</p>\n<h3>Nice feedback! Next question. How does Data Controller make your life easier?</h3>\n<p>Because it's so easy to use. Before we used an excel spreadsheet and it was quite unwieldy and it was bulky and it was so easy to make mistakes, just trying to remember where you were. And with Data Controller I love that I can filter first and get to exactly where I want to be and then I can edit. So, it really lessens the chance of me making a mistake. I love that, I am an editor, I am not an approver, but I like so I make an edit, but then it goes to an approver, so it’s like the four eye principle, something we did not have before. You can track changes, that’s amazing. Yeah, it made everything easier so whereas before I would dread updating the Smart Data Catalog, now you go in and it’s done in like 3 to 5 minutes.</p>\n<h3>Superb. Ok, before Data Controller came along, how did you get data into SAS?</h3>\n<p>So again, it was the foundation of this spreadsheet. You would have to check it out so there was some control over it. If somebody checked it out then nobody else could go in and make any changes, and you would have to wait for it to be checked back in and then run like a macro or some tool and then you could upload it and you could update your smart data search. It was a process that depended on how careful your co-workers were about remembering to check it back in. In short, it used to often take days to update the SAS environment, and now it takes minutes.</p>\n<h3>Wow - that’s great to hear! Ok, Next up. What are your favourite Data Controller features and why?</h3>\n<p>The filter. It will always be my favourite; it will never change. That’s really helpful. I just like how it makes it so much harder to make a mistake. With Data Controller it’s much harder to make a mistake. It’s less prone to human error. And the copy and paste is so easy, and yeah, there is nothing about it that I don’t love.</p>\n<h3>Brilliant, I think that’s the best feedback we’ve ever had.</h3>\n<p>Really, I mean it has made our lives so much easier, so much faster. Um yeah, I just love it.</p>\n<h3>Thankyou so much!</h3>\n<hr>\n<h2>Hans-Juergen <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hans-juergen-kopperger-942634b7/\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-1181\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0-1-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Hans-Juergen\" width=\"150\" height=\"225\" /></a></h2>\n<h3>Guten Morgen Hans-Juergen! Can you tell us a little about your role within the business?</h3>\n<p>Yes, I am working as a Data Integration Manager at Siemens Healthineers providing BI and Analytical Services for our colleagues. My department is the DGA - Data Governance and Analytical Services. At Siemens-Healthineers we are analyzing \"Big Data\" from our computer systems - AT Angiography and Therapy, Computer Tomography CT, MR Magnetresonanz Tomography, and LD Labordiagnostik.</p>\n<p>In consequence of our Business Strategy \"from Onsite to Online\" our focus is to connect more and more systems to our BI backend. With new services like \"Condition-based Maintenance\" or \"Predictive Analysis\", we can now generate data-driven services to increase business values for our customers or even decrease our overall service costs.</p>\n<p>Our BI platform is based on the SAS technology stack. To get our Business Analysts and Data Scientists nearer to our Data Lake I have created a Smart Data Catalog which is an interactive web application with a \"google style\" search facility. Now they can do their jobs more effectively without struggling to find and access accurate, complete, and trustworthy data. As a result, they spend less time searching for data and can actually focus on using data to generate analyses and impactful insights.</p>\n<h3>Now that's valuable! And what do you use Data Controller for?</h3>\n<p>To increase Data Quality while uploading backend data into our BI platform. Data Controller provides “data version control”, and full traceability of changes. We have several control tables that provide data for web applications like the \"Smart Data Catalog\", and with Data Controller it's now an easy, controllable and manageable process to get these changes into the backend tables.</p>\n<p>In the past we had a custom Stored Process web app for uploading excel files, based on an excel template. This process had negative consequences for Data Quality because it often happened that many different versions of the excel templates were created and in the end we didn't know which was the latest version and which values we wanted to upload into the system. It could take a lot of time to clarify who had done which upload.</p>\n<p>I would often receive support tickets in relation to this upload, the cause of which was often due to the diversity of our excel templates, and being unsure which was the right template...So, we would have a lot of discussions about how to bring data into the backend in a controlled manner.</p>\n<p>Then one day, I got information through <a href=\"https://sasusergroup.de/\">SAS User Group Germany</a> that you provide a solution with Data Controller. I was initially interested in the <a href=\"https://docs.datacontroller.io/videos/#data-lineage\">Data Lineage</a> functionality, but then I understood the main concept behind Data Controller. And for me the main benefit is that I can save a lot of time - with out of the box features like the web data editor, and the web upload facility with excel spreadsheet drag and drop. And there is the automatic workflow behind with the mandatory approval step. Since we implemented Data Controller, we no longer get those support tickets.</p>\n<h3>Fantastic. If you had to pick your top features, what would they be?</h3>\n<p>The main benefit is getting data controlled, and into the backend. The controlled process, and the approval process, those are the main benefits. But we've got other benefits. For instance, we have Data Lineage now. The Data Lineage diagrams could also be linked directly from our Smart Data Catalog using URL parameters. This easy integration means our users can open the relevant page in Data Controller with one click.</p>\n<p>The transparency of the history page is another benefit. I can look at every requested submit or approval - what changes have been applied, what changes have been submitted, and what changes have been approved. This helps us a lot to get data transparency.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.datacontroller.io/emails/\">email alerts</a> is a great feature. For the communication of changes, we had previously created a team's collaboration chat. e.g. if someone did a change and needed to request an approval. But with email alerts, the notification of changes is now automatically sent to the responsible data owner, who can immediately click the email link and do his approval. This speeds up the whole process.</p>\n<p>Another advantage is the \"database approach\" for updates. So, someone is changing one row in a table which is connected to his use case, another guy can change other rows of the same table, nearly simultaneously. Because not everyone is changing the same rows. Everyone has their own subset of rows, their own \"workspace\" within one table. In the past we would have one excel template, and this would always override all values. We would have a lot of excel templates going around our colleagues, so there were always conflicts of overrides and versioning, and stuff like that. With Data Controller, it's now a simple, easy and transparent data capture process.</p>\n<h3>Vielen Dank!</h3>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"imgHolder\">\n  <a href=\"/blog\">\n    <img class=\"wp-image-1190 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Get-Started-Smart-Data-Catalog.png\" alt=\"Smart Data Catalog\" />\n    <div>Smart Data Catalog</div>\n  </a>\n</div>","fields":{"slug":"/siemens-healthineers-smart-data-catalog/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Siemens Healthineers Smart Data Catalog and Data Controller","date":"August 24, 2020","author":"Allan Bowe","authorLink":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanbowe/","previewImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/948c1/siemenshealthineers.png","srcSet":"/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/f95d8/siemenshealthineers.png 144w,\n/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/3fffe/siemenshealthineers.png 288w,\n/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/948c1/siemenshealthineers.png 576w","sizes":"(min-width: 576px) 576px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/13995/siemenshealthineers.webp 144w,\n/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/7ee31/siemenshealthineers.webp 288w,\n/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/27686/siemenshealthineers.webp 576w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 576px) 576px, 100vw"}]},"width":576,"height":144}}}}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>We caught up with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/herbert-gro%C3%9Fmann-53690517a/\">Herbert Grossmann</a> of DER Touristik to understand how Data Controller for SAS is used within the BICC and the types of challenges it solves. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/herbert-gro%C3%9Fmann-53690517a/\"><img class=\" wp-image-1137 alignright\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"183\" height=\"183\" /></a> The previous article in this series can be found <a href=\"/data-controller-developer-perspective/\">here</a>. <h2>Guten Tag, Herby! Can you tell us about your role within DER Touristik?</h2> Yes, I am working here as project manager for BI and Analytics and my department is the BICC (Business Intelligence Competence Centre), and we have an absolute focus on the SAS technology stack - so that’s my daily business. <h2>Great. And, I understand you guys are using Data Controller for SAS. What do you use it for?</h2> Well, mainly for managing control tables, that we have a lot of nowadays, in the data warehouse. But we also implemented what we call an \"early bird booking system\". There we have used the Approval process within Data Controller, which is excellent, because users, business departments etc, can approve data that would normally only be accessible within the back-end warehouse itself. So now they have an interface, which limits their access to specific views, and this is very useful - it was also highly commended by our management. <h2>So, business users can approve modifications to secure warehouse tables without having direct write-access themselves?</h2> Exactly <h2>Fantastic. Next question. How does having Data Controller make your life easier?</h2> Well - there is the version control of course, that gives us a much better traceability of changes to see what was changed by whom, at what time. And we have the immediate constraint checking which is also very useful because some of the tables are sensitive towards, let’s say, the changes of the primary key. And in the past when we did it the \"old fashioned way\" it was possible that by mistake that someone could cause duplicate primary keys or stuff like that, so this is now not possible anymore, which is very good. And like the example that I mentioned before, that now we can grant access to certain sensitive tables even for business users that would normally have no access, but we can decide whether to give them at least the right to <em>view</em> these tables, or during special events <em>edit</em> tables, or approve edits of those tables. So this gives a lot of opportunities, and makes it much easier than it was in the past. <h2>Nice! And so, talking about the past, before you had Data Controller, how did you manage modifications to data in SAS?</h2> We classically used two approaches - on one hand using SAS Enterprise Guide to directly edit tables or do imports, such as imports of excel sheets for example. On the other hand, we have some batch processes that also do imports of Excel tables or CSV tables. So those were the classic and standard ways. And of course especially the batch one we are still using for some files, depending on the situation. But we do no editing of tables directly with Enterprise Guide anymore because it is much safer and easier to use the Data Controller. <h2>Understood. So on the Data Controller side, what would you say were your favourite features and why?</h2> I would say that I like the editor as a whole very much. I think that is great that in the moment you make a table editable, you can define the ways in which you would edit the tables. Like whether there is some historic logging or not, and the fact you can set the constraints. And in the editor then you have a lot of Data Quality opportunities such as defining drop-down lists for certain attributes, which really makes editing the tables easier and much more comfortable. It was a little bit of a pain in the past but now it’s almost fun. <h2>That's great feedback! Is there anything else, any comments you would like to add?</h2> Yes, I like the fact that Data Controller is really just a part of the SAS environment. It’s not a completely separate application that you have to install somewhere, but a kind of pluggable part of the SAS environment. I liked it very much because then you still have everything in your hands. I mean I am not a developer but my knowledge of SAS is already enough to match the criteria to be able to handle the Data Controller as whole, to even do the updates and/or to modify things. And also it’s easy to show others who have experience with SAS how the tool works and what is to be done when there are data issues. And yeah, I think that’s a big advantage. <img class=\"wp-image-1140 aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Group-1dt-1-e1597092362693.png\" alt=\"SAS DER Touristik\" width=\"242\" height=\"213\" /></p>","fields":{"slug":"/der-touristik/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Data Controller - a BICC perspective","date":"August 10, 2020","author":"Allan Bowe","authorLink":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanbowe/","previewImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/65ef577f76c9ed7ba6a2816ffe8962c3/026c5/Group-1dt.png","srcSet":"/static/65ef577f76c9ed7ba6a2816ffe8962c3/1cc48/Group-1dt.png 219w,\n/static/65ef577f76c9ed7ba6a2816ffe8962c3/fe261/Group-1dt.png 438w,\n/static/65ef577f76c9ed7ba6a2816ffe8962c3/026c5/Group-1dt.png 875w","sizes":"(min-width: 875px) 875px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/65ef577f76c9ed7ba6a2816ffe8962c3/d8972/Group-1dt.webp 219w,\n/static/65ef577f76c9ed7ba6a2816ffe8962c3/360f3/Group-1dt.webp 438w,\n/static/65ef577f76c9ed7ba6a2816ffe8962c3/e6409/Group-1dt.webp 875w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 875px) 875px, 100vw"}]},"width":875,"height":768}}}}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>When applying financial regulations in the EU (such as Solvency II, Basel III or GDPR) it is common for Member States to maintain or introduce national provisions to further specify how such rules might be applied. The National Bank of Belgium (NBB) is no stranger to this, and releases a steady stream of circulars via their <a href=\"https://www.nbb.be/en/financial-oversight/general/news/circulars-and-communications\">website</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.nbb.be/doc/cp/eng/2017/20171012_nbb_2017_27.pdf\">circular</a> of 12th October 2017 (NBB_2017_27, Jan Smets) is particularly interesting as it lays out a number of concrete recommendations for Belgian financial institutions with regard to Data Quality - and stated that these should be applied to internal reporting processes as well as the prudential data submitted. This fact is well known by affected industry participants, who have already performed a self assessment for YE2017 and reviewed documentation expectations as part of the HY2018 submission. <h2>Quality of External Data</h2> The DQ requirements for reporting are described by the 6 <a href=\"https://www.nbb.be/doc/cp/eng/2017/20171012_nbb_2017_27_annex.pdf\">dimensions</a> (Accuracy, Reliability, Completeness, Consistency, Plausibility, Timeliness), as well as the Data Quality Framework described by Patrick Hogan <a href=\"https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/conferences/sup_rep_conf/shared/pdf/Item4_1_PatrickHogan.pdf\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/conferences/sup_rep_conf/shared/pdf/2017/Data_quality_framework_tools_and_products.pdf\">here</a>. There are a number of 'hard checks' implemented in OneGate as part of the XBRL submissions, which are kept up to date <a href=\"http://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-analysis-and-data/reporting-frameworks\">here</a>. However, OneGate cannot be used as a validation tool - the regulators will be monitoring the <strong>reliability</strong> of submissions by comparing the magnitude of change between resubmissions! Not to mention the data <strong>plausibility</strong> (changes in submitted values over time). <h2>Data Quality Culture</h2> When it comes to internal processes, CRO's across Belgium must now demonstrate to accredited statutory auditors that they satisfy the 3 Principles of the circular (Governance, Technical Capacities, Process). A long list of action points are detailed - it's clear that a <em>lot</em> of documentation will be required to fulfil these obligations! And not only that - the documentation will need to be continually updated and maintained. It's fair to say that automated solutions have the potential to provide significant time &#x26; cost savings in this regard. <h2>Data Controller for SAS®</h2> The Data Controller is a web based solution for capturing data from users. Data Quality is applied at source, changes are routed through an approval process before being applied, and all updates are captured for subsequent audit. The tool provides evidence of compliance with NBB_2017_27 in the following ways: <h4>Separation of Roles for Data Preparation and Validation (principle 1.2)</h4> Data Controller differentiates between Editors (who provide the data) and Approvers (who sign it off). Editors stage data via the web interface, or by direct file upload. Approvers are then shown the new, changed, or deleted records - and can accept or reject the update. <a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-13-at-22.50.56.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-962\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-13-at-22.50.56.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"553\" height=\"296\" /></a></p>\n<h4>Capacities established should ensure compliance in times of stress (principle 2.1)</h4>\nAs an Enterprise tool, the Data Controller is as scalable and resilient as your existing SAS platform.\n<h4>Capture of Errors and Inconsistencies (principle 2.2)</h4> Data Controller has a number of features to ensure timely detection of Data Quality issues at source (such as cell validation, post edit hook scripts, duplicate removals, rejection of data with missing columns, etc etc). Where errors do make it into the system, a full history is kept (logs, copies of files etc) for all uploads and approvals. Emails of such errors can be configured for follow up. <h4>Tools and Techniques for Information Management Should be Automated (principle 2.3)</h4> The Data Controller can be configured to execute specific .sas programs after data validation. This enables the development of a secure and <em>integrated</em> workflow, and helps companies to avoid the additional documentation penalties associated with \"miscellaneous unconnected computer applications\" and manual information processing. <a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-13-at-22.53.38.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-963\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-13-at-22.53.38.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"278\" height=\"128\" /></a> &nbsp; <h4>Periodic Review &amp; Improvements (principles 2.4 and 3.4)</h4> The Data Controller is actively maintained with the specific aim to reduce the cost of compliance with regulations such as NBB_2017_27. Our <a href=\"https://slides.com/allanbowe/datacontroller/#/\">roadmap</a> includes new features such as pre-canned reports, version 'signoff', and the ability to reinstate previous versions of data. <h4>A process for correction and final validation of reporting before submission (3.1)</h4> As a primary and dedicated tool for data corrections, Data Controller can be described once and used everywhere. <h4>List of Divisions Involved in Preparing Tables (principle 3.2)</h4> By using the Data Controller in combination with knowledge of data lineage (eg from SAS metadata or manual lookup table) it becomes possible to produce an automated report to identify exactly who - and hence which division - was involved in both the preparation and the validation of the all source data per reporting table for each reporting cycle. <h4>Processes should integrate and document key controls (principle 3.3)</h4> Data Controller can be used as a staging point for verifying the quality of data, eg when data from one department must be passed to another department for processing. The user access policy will be as per the existing policy for your SAS environment. <h2>Summary</h2> Whilst the circular provides valuable clarity on the expectations of the NBB, there are significant costs involved to prepare for, and maintain, compliance with the guidance. This is especially the case where reporting processes are disparate, and make use of disconnected EUCs and manual processes. The Data Controller for SAS® addresses and automates a number of pain points as specifically described in the circular.
