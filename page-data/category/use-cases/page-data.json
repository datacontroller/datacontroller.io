This enables results for any previous reporting period to be reproduced 'as at' any point in time, providing full auditability and traceability. By using Data Controller, the actuarial team at Allianz were able to upload data from multiple sources, and have it automatically merged into their SAS reporting database. We caught up with Joris Jansen, Actuary for P&#x26;C Reserving.</p>\n<hr>\n<img class=\"alignright\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/view.jpeg\" alt=\"Data Controller for SAS at Allianz Insurance\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" />\n<h3>Joris, hallo! Could you please explain to us, your role within Allianz?</h3>\n<p>My role, Allan, is a \"reporting role\" in the business of the Allianz Benelux insurance company. This means that every month I need to report all the figures to my management in an accurate, complete and timely way - and this is important for Allianz Management in order to steer the company in the right way. I'm responsible for ensuring the reporting processes are performed properly, and of course, that the output is correct. The Data Controller is helping me to do this.</p>\n<h3>Great! And how does it help? What do you use Data Controller for?</h3>\n<p>The Data Controller I use for the upload of the source data for my calculations. You can imagine I have source data from let's say, different systems or queries or whatever, and I upload this with the Data Controller. I then have the data available and can perform my calculations on the data in SAS, and output the figures for reporting.</p>\n<h3>And why is it that you use Data Controller and not any other tools for uploading that data?</h3>\n<p>Well I think that you, Allan, have given Allianz a really easy tool to use, to do this part in a uniform, simple and proper way. Also the sources are from different systems so the unification of those different data sources isn't that easy - and Data Controller is a really simple tool to make that happen. I have my inputs from different systems available and in a relatively easy way I can upload them.</p>\n<p>Automation may be much better but it's not that easy and practical to do.</p>\n<h3>I see. And what format do these files arrive in?</h3>\n<p>The inputs are all Excel or CSV files and it's easy to input them.</p>\n<h3>What happens to this data after it is uploaded?</h3>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://docs.datacontroller.io/dcc-tables/#pre_edit_hook\">hook script</a> that runs after the upload that makes sure that all the data is captured in one big database, which is a convenient way to handle the data so it's all together in one place. Before Data Controller, this wasn't the case. The advantage of having this data all merged automatically with each upload means that our subsequent processes that calculate the amounts as an output from the source is more uniform. Where we previously had many programs and input locations that would make calculations on top of one another, there are now just 1 to 3 programs.</p>\n<h3>Is anyone else making use of Data Controller?</h3>\n<p>Currently there are three heavy users, and also other departments make use of it, eg the audit department, concerned with models and calculations, will make checks to ensure it works properly on a regular basis.</p>\n<h3>What would you say are your favourite features in Data Controller, and why?</h3>\n<p>The most important feature is the uniform way in which data is uploaded and merged automatically in one database. Which means we always have our data, in an accurate and complete way, available. It is not that easy to adjust the database, and before Data Controller was in place it was possible to accidentally modify data because it was just sitting on the directory, the network drive. It is now not so easy to do that, the data is uploaded in a uniform way and always protected. We have a better, more proper way of reporting.</p>\n<p>The second is that if auditors have extra questions, or would like to investigate other scenarios for calculating the outputs, then we can re-perform very easily the calculation because the data is already available [* with bi-temporal history in a database]. We don't need to do something extra, we can recalculate whenever we want. It's not something we use regularly but it is there, if there are questions from audit or if we would like to change something on the longer term etc, for change management purposes. This is a very nice feature.</p>\n<h3>Glad to hear it! Is there anything you'd like to see in DC?</h3>\n<p>I'm currently very satisfied, it works, it's very fast, it's really quick to use. Which makes it very efficient.</p>\n<h3>Erg bedankt!</h3>\n<hr>\n<p>The previous article in this series is available <a href=\"/siemens-healthineers-smart-data-catalog/\">here</a>.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/allianz-insurance-data-controller-sas/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Allianz Insurance and Data Controller for SAS®","date":"March 26, 2021","author":"Allan Bowe","authorLink":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanbowe/","previewImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#082888","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5908c8879af74a978e5a2c7e9e14c398/43df1/Allianz_logo.svg_.png","srcSet":"/static/5908c8879af74a978e5a2c7e9e14c398/59dc1/Allianz_logo.svg_.png 300w,\n/static/5908c8879af74a978e5a2c7e9e14c398/a4f11/Allianz_logo.svg_.png 600w,\n/static/5908c8879af74a978e5a2c7e9e14c398/43df1/Allianz_logo.svg_.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5908c8879af74a978e5a2c7e9e14c398/f17fd/Allianz_logo.svg_.webp 300w,\n/static/5908c8879af74a978e5a2c7e9e14c398/76f3d/Allianz_logo.svg_.webp 600w,\n/static/5908c8879af74a978e5a2c7e9e14c398/5e38a/Allianz_logo.svg_.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":536}}}}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>Data Controller was implemented at Siemens Healthineers to facilitate their SAS-Powered Smart Data Catalog and integrate with Data Lineage reporting.

Can you tell us - what is your role within the business?</h3>\n<p>I am the portfolio manager. What I do is a lot of demand management. So when people have new requests, like they want new data into our data lake, or they want it structured, or they want it visualized then I manage all that. For the Americas region, for North and south America. And I also do road shows, like marketing kind of aspect for the data scientists. And I do a smidge of project management here and there.</p>\n<h3>Interesting. And what do you actually use Data Controller for?</h3>\n<p>I use it to keep our Smart Data Catalog up to date. One of the things that I do is we have marketing posters, and so I put the links to those marketing posters in there so they are a part of our front end web design. And I also do the marketing videos, so adding those links. So really it’s just adding and deleting entries into Data Controller, so that our Smart Data Catalog is updated at all times.</p>\n<h3>And that Smart Data Catalog is in SAS. Is there reason its in SAS, and not say - Excel? Is it used by other parts of the business?</h3>\n<p>Yes, it’s used by the entire business</p>\n<h3>I see. And what is the Smart Data Catalog?</h3>\n<p>It's a listing of all of the offerings that data governance has. So, I say data governance but its data governance and analytical services. So, we are the data owners for all of the data in the company. It’s the single source of truth for all Siemens health business data. And we use Data Controller to manage that. And Data Controller does some incredible things that I do not understand – such as being able to stage and preview the data before it’s made publicly available. I mean I honestly don’t understand it but it does some miraculous things.</p>\n<h3>Nice feedback! Next question. How does Data Controller make your life easier?</h3>\n<p>Because it's so easy to use. Before we used an excel spreadsheet and it was quite unwieldy and it was bulky and it was so easy to make mistakes, just trying to remember where you were. And with Data Controller I love that I can filter first and get to exactly where I want to be and then I can edit. So, it really lessens the chance of me making a mistake. I love that, I am an editor, I am not an approver, but I like so I make an edit, but then it goes to an approver, so it’s like the four eye principle, something we did not have before. You can track changes, that’s amazing. Yeah, it made everything easier so whereas before I would dread updating the Smart Data Catalog, now you go in and it’s done in like 3 to 5 minutes.</p>\n<h3>Superb. Ok, before Data Controller came along, how did you get data into SAS?</h3>\n<p>So again, it was the foundation of this spreadsheet. You would have to check it out so there was some control over it. If somebody checked it out then nobody else could go in and make any changes, and you would have to wait for it to be checked back in and then run like a macro or some tool and then you could upload it and you could update your smart data search. It was a process that depended on how careful your co-workers were about remembering to check it back in. In short, it used to often take days to update the SAS environment, and now it takes minutes.</p>\n<h3>Wow - that’s great to hear! Ok, Next up. What are your favourite Data Controller features and why?</h3>\n<p>The filter. It will always be my favourite; it will never change. That’s really helpful. I just like how it makes it so much harder to make a mistake. With Data Controller it’s much harder to make a mistake. It’s less prone to human error. And the copy and paste is so easy, and yeah, there is nothing about it that I don’t love.</p>\n<h3>Brilliant, I think that’s the best feedback we’ve ever had.</h3>\n<p>Really, I mean it has made our lives so much easier, so much faster. Um yeah, I just love it.</p>\n<h3>Thankyou so much!</h3>\n<hr>\n<h2>Hans-Juergen <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hans-juergen-kopperger-942634b7/\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-1181\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0-1-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Hans-Juergen\" width=\"150\" height=\"225\" /></a></h2>\n<h3>Guten Morgen Hans-Juergen! Can you tell us a little about your role within the business?</h3>\n<p>Yes, I am working as a Data Integration Manager at Siemens Healthineers providing BI and Analytical Services for our colleagues. My department is the DGA - Data Governance and Analytical Services. At Siemens-Healthineers we are analyzing \"Big Data\" from our computer systems - AT Angiography and Therapy, Computer Tomography CT, MR Magnetresonanz Tomography, and LD Labordiagnostik.</p>\n<p>In consequence of our Business Strategy \"from Onsite to Online\" our focus is to connect more and more systems to our BI backend. With new services like \"Condition-based Maintenance\" or \"Predictive Analysis\", we can now generate data-driven services to increase business values for our customers or even decrease our overall service costs.</p>\n<p>Our BI platform is based on the SAS technology stack. To get our Business Analysts and Data Scientists nearer to our Data Lake I have created a Smart Data Catalog which is an interactive web application with a \"google style\" search facility. Now they can do their jobs more effectively without struggling to find and access accurate, complete, and trustworthy data. As a result, they spend less time searching for data and can actually focus on using data to generate analyses and impactful insights.</p>\n<h3>Now that's valuable! And what do you use Data Controller for?</h3>\n<p>To increase Data Quality while uploading backend data into our BI platform. Data Controller provides “data version control”, and full traceability of changes. We have several control tables that provide data for web applications like the \"Smart Data Catalog\", and with Data Controller it's now an easy, controllable and manageable process to get these changes into the backend tables.</p>\n<p>In the past we had a custom Stored Process web app for uploading excel files, based on an excel template. This process had negative consequences for Data Quality because it often happened that many different versions of the excel templates were created and in the end we didn't know which was the latest version and which values we wanted to upload into the system. It could take a lot of time to clarify who had done which upload.</p>\n<p>I would often receive support tickets in relation to this upload, the cause of which was often due to the diversity of our excel templates, and being unsure which was the right template...So, we would have a lot of discussions about how to bring data into the backend in a controlled manner.</p>\n<p>Then one day, I got information through <a href=\"https://sasusergroup.de/\">SAS User Group Germany</a> that you provide a solution with Data Controller. I was initially interested in the <a href=\"https://docs.datacontroller.io/videos/#data-lineage\">Data Lineage</a> functionality, but then I understood the main concept behind Data Controller. And for me the main benefit is that I can save a lot of time - with out of the box features like the web data editor, and the web upload facility with excel spreadsheet drag and drop. And there is the automatic workflow behind with the mandatory approval step. Since we implemented Data Controller, we no longer get those support tickets.</p>\n<h3>Fantastic. If you had to pick your top features, what would they be?</h3>\n<p>The main benefit is getting data controlled, and into the backend. The controlled process, and the approval process, those are the main benefits. But we've got other benefits. For instance, we have Data Lineage now. The Data Lineage diagrams could also be linked directly from our Smart Data Catalog using URL parameters. This easy integration means our users can open the relevant page in Data Controller with one click.</p>\n<p>The transparency of the history page is another benefit. I can look at every requested submit or approval - what changes have been applied, what changes have been submitted, and what changes have been approved. This helps us a lot to get data transparency.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.datacontroller.io/emails/\">email alerts</a> is a great feature. For the communication of changes, we had previously created a team's collaboration chat. e.g. if someone did a change and needed to request an approval. But with email alerts, the notification of changes is now automatically sent to the responsible data owner, who can immediately click the email link and do his approval. This speeds up the whole process.</p>\n<p>Another advantage is the \"database approach\" for updates. So, someone is changing one row in a table which is connected to his use case, another guy can change other rows of the same table, nearly simultaneously. Because not everyone is changing the same rows. Everyone has their own subset of rows, their own \"workspace\" within one table. In the past we would have one excel template, and this would always override all values. We would have a lot of excel templates going around our colleagues, so there were always conflicts of overrides and versioning, and stuff like that. With Data Controller, it's now a simple, easy and transparent data capture process.</p>\n<h3>Vielen Dank!</h3>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"imgHolder\">\n  <a href=\"/blog\">\n    <img class=\"wp-image-1190 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Get-Started-Smart-Data-Catalog.png\" alt=\"Smart Data Catalog\" />\n    <div>Smart Data Catalog</div>\n  </a>\n</div>","fields":{"slug":"/siemens-healthineers-smart-data-catalog/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Siemens Healthineers Smart Data Catalog and Data Controller","date":"August 24, 2020","author":"Allan Bowe","authorLink":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanbowe/","previewImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/948c1/siemenshealthineers.png","srcSet":"/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/f95d8/siemenshealthineers.png 144w,\n/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/3fffe/siemenshealthineers.png 288w,\n/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/948c1/siemenshealthineers.png 576w","sizes":"(min-width: 576px) 576px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/13995/siemenshealthineers.webp 144w,\n/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/7ee31/siemenshealthineers.webp 288w,\n/static/3fa98b7c15a2f6a7600a40df10a0df34/27686/siemenshealthineers.webp 576w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 576px) 576px, 100vw"}]},"width":576,"height":144}}}}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>We caught up with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/herbert-gro%C3%9Fmann-53690517a/\">Herbert Grossmann</a> of DER Touristik to understand how Data Controller for SAS is used within the BICC and the types of challenges it solves. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/herbert-gro%C3%9Fmann-53690517a/\"><img class=\" wp-image-1137 alignright\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"183\" height=\"183\" /></a> The previous article in this series can be found <a href=\"/data-controller-developer-perspective/\">here</a>. <h2>Guten Tag, Herby! Can you tell us about your role within DER Touristik?</h2> Yes, I am working here as project manager for BI and Analytics and my department is the BICC (Business Intelligence Competence Centre), and we have an absolute focus on the SAS technology stack - so that’s my daily business. <h2>Great. And, I understand you guys are using Data Controller for SAS. What do you use it for?</h2> Well, mainly for managing control tables, that we have a lot of nowadays, in the data warehouse. But we also implemented what we call an \"early bird booking system\". There we have used the Approval process within Data Controller, which is excellent, because users, business departments etc, can approve data that would normally only be accessible within the back-end warehouse itself. So now they have an interface, which limits their access to specific views, and this is very useful - it was also highly commended by our management. <h2>So, business users can approve modifications to secure warehouse tables without having direct write-access themselves?</h2> Exactly <h2>Fantastic. Next question. How does having Data Controller make your life easier?</h2> Well - there is the version control of course, that gives us a much better traceability of changes to see what was changed by whom, at what time. And we have the immediate constraint checking which is also very useful because some of the tables are sensitive towards, let’s say, the changes of the primary key. And in the past when we did it the \"old fashioned way\" it was possible that by mistake that someone could cause duplicate primary keys or stuff like that, so this is now not possible anymore, which is very good. And like the example that I mentioned before, that now we can grant access to certain sensitive tables even for business users that would normally have no access, but we can decide whether to give them at least the right to <em>view</em> these tables, or during special events <em>edit</em> tables, or approve edits of those tables. So this gives a lot of opportunities, and makes it much easier than it was in the past. <h2>Nice! And so, talking about the past, before you had Data Controller, how did you manage modifications to data in SAS?</h2> We classically used two approaches - on one hand using SAS Enterprise Guide to directly edit tables or do imports, such as imports of excel sheets for example. On the other hand, we have some batch processes that also do imports of Excel tables or CSV tables. So those were the classic and standard ways. And of course especially the batch one we are still using for some files, depending on the situation. But we do no editing of tables directly with Enterprise Guide anymore because it is much safer and easier to use the Data Controller. <h2>Understood. So on the Data Controller side, what would you say were your favourite features and why?</h2> I would say that I like the editor as a whole very much. I think that is great that in the moment you make a table editable, you can define the ways in which you would edit the tables. Like whether there is some historic logging or not, and the fact you can set the constraints. And in the editor then you have a lot of Data Quality opportunities such as defining drop-down lists for certain attributes, which really makes editing the tables easier and much more comfortable. It was a little bit of a pain in the past but now it’s almost fun. <h2>That's great feedback! Is there anything else, any comments you would like to add?</h2> Yes, I like the fact that Data Controller is really just a part of the SAS environment. It’s not a completely separate application that you have to install somewhere, but a kind of pluggable part of the SAS environment. I liked it very much because then you still have everything in your hands. I mean I am not a developer but my knowledge of SAS is already enough to match the criteria to be able to handle the Data Controller as whole, to even do the updates and/or to modify things. And also it’s easy to show others who have experience with SAS how the tool works and what is to be done when there are data issues. And yeah, I think that’s a big advantage. <img class=\"wp-image-1140 aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Group-1dt-1-e1597092362693.png\" alt=\"SAS DER Touristik\" width=\"242\" height=\"213\" /></p>","fields":{"slug":"/der-touristik/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Data Controller - a BICC perspective","date":"August 10, 2020","author":"Allan Bowe","authorLink":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanbowe/","previewImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/65ef577f76c9ed7ba6a2816ffe8962c3/026c5/Group-1dt.png","srcSet":"/static/65ef577f76c9ed7ba6a2816ffe8962c3/1cc48/Group-1dt.png 219w,\n/static/65ef577f76c9ed7ba6a2816ffe8962c3/fe261/Group-1dt.png 438w,\n/static/65ef577f76c9ed7ba6a2816ffe8962c3/026c5/Group-1dt.png 875w","sizes":"(min-width: 875px) 875px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/65ef577f76c9ed7ba6a2816ffe8962c3/d8972/Group-1dt.webp 219w,\n/static/65ef577f76c9ed7ba6a2816ffe8962c3/360f3/Group-1dt.webp 438w,\n/static/65ef577f76c9ed7ba6a2816ffe8962c3/e6409/Group-1dt.webp 875w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 875px) 875px, 100vw"}]},"width":875,"height":768}}}}}},{"post":{"html":"<h1>What problem does Data Controller for SAS® solve?</h1>\n<div class=\"imgHolder alignright\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rgagor/\"><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG-20190430-WA0049.jpg\" alt=\"Rafal Gagor - Veteran SAS Developer\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\" /></a><div><span>Rafal Gagor - Veteran SAS Developer</span></div></div>\n<p>It's a question we get asked a lot, and so this is the first of a series of articles that explore real users and their actual use cases. We caught up with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rgagor/\">Rafal Gagor</a>, a DI Developer with 2 decades of SAS and Financial Services experience, to get his impressions after using Data Controller for SAS on a client project.</p>\n<h2>So, Rafal - what did your Client use Data Controller for?</h2>\n<p>Data Controller was implemented initially as the backbone of a <a href=\"https://sasjs.io\">SASjs</a> Release Management system - it allowed my colleagues and I to upload, for each promote, a list of affected SAS artefacts along with details of the release, and associated JIRA tickets. We could make changes directly via the web interface, or by uploading an Excel file. It was great to capture that information automatically in a database and have data quality rules applied at source. The resultant \"clean\" data enabled the delivery of a robust release management web application that saved hours of manual effort each week.</p>\n<h2>Nice use case. How did you manage before you had Data Controller?</h2>\n<p>Previously, release management was a process performed manually and inconsistently, with data scattered across dozens of Excel and Word documents - it was not brought into SAS at all. In the case of other, regular, business-sourced tables that needed to be uploaded - the options were to either hand-craft an upload process manually as a \"one off\" using Enterprise Guide, or to build (and deploy) an ETL flow sourced from an Excel or a CSV file deployed to a network drive.</p>\n<p>This option was problematic - how frequently to run the flow? What if the file format changed? What if the target table changed? It was therefore quite convenient to have the ability to hand such processes back to the data owner, who could safely modify the data within Data Controller without running the risk of overwriting any indexes or otherwise changing the schema of the table.</p>\n<h2>Last question. What were your favourite Data Controller features?</h2>\n<p>Probably my favourite feature was the <strong>Metadata Navigator</strong> - I hadn't been able to use this since moving away from Base SAS quite some years ago. It was useful to be able to navigate through the objects and associations, and view the properties and attributes, without writing any code. Next up was the <strong>Data Lineage</strong> explorer.</p>\n<p>When the business told me there was an issue with a particular field, it was really helpful to use the Data Controller graphical tools - at both table and column level - to perform a reverse (Target to Source) lineage diagram and quickly understand the data flow. This avoided the need to open up every job in DI Studio and explore the transforms.</p>\n<p>Although it's a basic feature, it was great to use the <strong>Data Viewer</strong> to quickly examine and explore the raw tables without locking the datasets (and hence running the risk of stopping a batch run). The full-table search was a neat touch, as well as the DDL export option. Finally, I liked the fact that there were separate buttons for SUBMIT and APPROVE - a bit like a database where you have to commit the change. It's a nice approach that gives an extra layer of validation for the changes uploaded.</p>\n<h2>Rafal - many thanks!</h2>","fields":{"slug":"/data-controller-developer-perspective/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Data Controller - a Developer Perspective","date":"July 29, 2020","author":"Allan Bowe","authorLink":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanbowe/","previewImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3795074afaa91c078996114db15428dc/1696a/IMG-20190430-WA0049.jpg","srcSet":"/static/3795074afaa91c078996114db15428dc/cf6cb/IMG-20190430-WA0049.jpg 63w,\n/static/3795074afaa91c078996114db15428dc/7f937/IMG-20190430-WA0049.jpg 125w,\n/static/3795074afaa91c078996114db15428dc/1696a/IMG-20190430-WA0049.jpg 250w","sizes":"(min-width: 250px) 250px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3795074afaa91c078996114db15428dc/35c53/IMG-20190430-WA0049.webp 63w,\n/static/3795074afaa91c078996114db15428dc/70f7f/IMG-20190430-WA0049.webp 125w,\n/static/3795074afaa91c078996114db15428dc/af4b8/IMG-20190430-WA0049.webp 250w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 250px) 250px, 100vw"}]},"width":250,"height":300}}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"page":"category","archives":{"2018":2,"2020":5,"2021":8,"2022":4,"2023":3},"recentPosts":[{"slug":"/v6-1-source-available/","title":"v6.1 Release: Source Available"},{"slug":"/v6-0-api-explorer/","title":"v6.0 Release: Viya API Explorer"},{"slug":"/v5-3-viewboxes/","title":"v5.3 Release: ViewBoxes"},{"slug":"/v5-2-lineage-updates/","title":"v5.2 Release: Lineage Updates"},{"slug":"/v5-1-library-dataset-info/","title":"v5.1 Release: Library & Dataset Info"},{"slug":"/v5-0-column-level-security/","title":"v5.0 Release: Column Level Security"},{"slug":"/v4-0-formats-special-missings/","title":"v4.0 Release: Formats & Special Missings"},{"slug":"/3-13-extended-data-validation/","title":"v3.13 Release: Extended Data Validation and Native Postgres Support"},{"slug":"/saasnow-partnership/","title":"SaasNow Partnership"},{"slug":"/roi-payback/","title":"ROI and Payback"}],"tags":[{"name":"Releases","totalCount":10},{"name":"SAS","totalCount":8},{"name":"Data Lineage","totalCount":5},{"name":"Data Quality","totalCount":5},{"name":"Excel","totalCount":4},{"name":"Use Cases","totalCount":4},{"name":"Regulatory","totalCount":3},{"name":"Data Catalog","totalCount":2},{"name":"Data Management","totalCount":2},{"name":"EUC","totalCount":2}],"filter":{"frontmatter":{"tags":{"in":["Use Cases"]}}},"limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1,"tag":"Use Cases"}},"staticQueryHashes":["615294906"]}
