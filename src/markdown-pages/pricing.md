## Pricing Overview

- Up to 5 users - FREE
- Up to 200 users - 500 EUR per User per Year
- Additional users over 200 - FREE

## Pricing Details

Data Controller is FREE for up to 5 users, with "best endeavours" support, and without permission to re-use the data management macros. For these, a subscription is required.

Subscriptions are based on the number of Users - a user is a unique SAS account that has registered to the Data Controller product in any 12 month period. Meaning, if you have a 20 user subscription, only 20 unique users are able to use Data Controller during those 12 months.

**The price is 500 EUR per user per annum.**  The minimum purchase is 10 users.   The cost of additional user licenses is pro-rated by months remaining in the current annual subscription period.

Licences can be downgraded. Downgrades happen on licence anniversary, with a minimum decrease of 10 users. 

Above 200 users the price is capped, and a dedicated account manager is made available.

## Discounts

Discounts are available for multi-year purchases, also for purchases of multiple instances (eg Viya + SAS 9).

- 2 years - 20% discount on 2nd year
- 3+ years purchased - 40% discount on 3rd and subsequent years
- Viya + SAS 9 - 50% discount on the additional licence (on top of yearly discounts).  Max user count will apply to both versions.

## Services

For Data Controller Consulting Projects, list price is 1200 EUR per day For Data Controller Development Activities (new product features etc), list price is 600 EUR per day.

## Support

### Mailbox

Our support mailbox is available at support@datacontroller.io - a trained Data Controller technician will respond to all queries within 8 business hours.  Business hours are Monday to Friday, 9am until 5pm GMT. We aim to meet these targets in 90% of all incidents reported.  Support issues will be worked on until a mutually agreed resolution is achieved, or until the customer requests the issue to be closed. If there is no response or update from a customer on an issue for more than 30 calendar days, the issue will be closed.

### In Scope Support

Support is unlimited, but restricted to items that actually relate to the tool (eg we cannot help with permissions, or data issues, beyond the guidance in the documentation).  All support is provided remotely, using video calls / screen sharing technology. Examples of ‘in-scope’ - configuration advice, usage, troubleshooting, installation support, integration advice (actual integration work would be a consulting effort).

### Out of Scope Support

Our support goal is to help you by answering questions and solving problems that relate specifically to the Data Controller for SAS® software. Occasionally a situation may arise where the scope is outside of the support service, including (but not limited to) the items below.

#### Data Issues

Whilst Data Controller has been hardened over many years to deal with most data issues, there are some things that cannot be solved by the product itself, such as:

- Library configuration issues
- Permissions issues (OS or metadata)
- Physical locks (eg on SAS tables)
- System issues (outages)

#### New Features

The Data Controller Support Team can assist with troubleshooting and issue support, but they cannot create additional functionality. In this case a request may be made to enhance the product, or our Professional Services may be engaged to deliver a bespoke solution.

#### Integrations

Data Controller was built to ‘play nicely’ with other tools and platforms. The Support Team can assist with education and advice on how those integrations work, but they cannot perform those integrations for you. In this case, our Professional Services team should be engaged.

#### Non Standard Situations

There may be situations where support cannot give immediate fixes, such as (but not limited to):

- Issues with client computing environments
- Inability of the client to provide remote access
- Regulatory or Force Majeure events In such cases the issue will be referred to management and a call arranged to agree a way forward.

### Partner Purchases

Where Data Controller is purchased directly from one of our partners, the partner may provide first line support as per your agreement with them.
