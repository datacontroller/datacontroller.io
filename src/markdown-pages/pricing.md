## Support

### Mailbox

Our support mailbox is available at support@datacontroller.io - a trained Data Controller technician will respond to all queries within 8 business hours (or 4 hours for customers on the Gold plan). Business hours are Monday to Friday, 9am until 5pm GMT.

We aim to meet this target in 90% of all incidents reported.  Support issues will be worked on until a mutually agreed resolution is achieved, or until the customer requests the issue to be closed. If there is no response or update from a customer on an issue for more than 30 calendar days, the issue will be deemed closed.

### In Scope Support

Support is unlimited, but restricted to items that actually relate to the tool (eg we cannot help with permissions, or data issues, beyond the guidance in the documentation).  All support is provided remotely, using video calls / screen sharing technology.

Examples of ‘in-scope’ (not an exhaustive list):

* configuration & usage advice
* troubleshooting
* installation / deployment support
* integration advice (actual integrations are a consulting effort)

### Out of Scope Support

Our support goal is to help you by answering questions and solving problems that relate specifically to the Data Controller for SAS® software, SASjs, or other in-house SAS-Powered Web Apps per the subscription plan.

Occasionally a situation may arise where the scope is outside of the support service, including (but not limited to) the items below.

#### Data Issues

Whilst Data Controller has been hardened over many years to deal with most data issues, there are some things that cannot be solved by the product itself, such as:

- Library configuration issues
- Permissions issues (OS or metadata)
- Physical locks (eg on SAS tables)
- System issues (outages)

#### New Features

The Data Controller Support Team can assist with troubleshooting and issue support, but they cannot create additional functionality. In this case a request may be made to enhance the product (Developer Days), or our Professional Services may be engaged to deliver a bespoke solution.

#### Integrations

Data Controller was built to ‘play nicely’ with other tools and platforms. The Support Team can assist with education and advice on how those integrations work, but they cannot perform those integrations for you. In this case, our Professional Services team should be engaged.

#### Non Standard Situations

There may be situations where support cannot give immediate fixes, such as (but not limited to):

- Issues with client computing environments
- Inability of the client to provide remote access
- Regulatory or Force Majeure events In such cases the issue will be referred to management and a call arranged to agree a way forward.

### Partner Purchases

Where Data Controller is purchased directly from one of our partners, the partner may provide first line support as per your agreement with them.
